 Riding High. The three major U.S. stock market indexes rose as investors looked ahead to Wednesday’s signing of the initial U.S.-China trade pact and geopolitical risks in general have eased. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 80 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8%. Midday Movers Albemarle (ticker: ALB) gained 4.9% after China indicated it would hold subsidies for electric cars steady, which provided support to lithium miners. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) rose 4.4% after J.P. Morgan raised its price target on the stock. Netflix (NFLX) gained 3.5% after the company’s films “The Irishman” and “Marriage Story” were both nominated for an Academy Award for best picture. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) was up 3.2% to an all-time high after B. Riley FBR raised its price target on the shares. Abiomed (ABMD) dropped 13.2% after the pharmaceutical company reported earnings and gave lower-than-expected guidance for its fiscal third quarter and fiscal 2020.

 Verizon Com munications’ Fios TV service was once on the cutting edge of cable TV. But the fiber-optic cable system has now lost subscribers in every quarter since 2016, including nearly a quarter of a million in its last four reported periods. Verizon reported having 4.2 million Fios TV customers at the end of September, along with 5.9 million Fios internet subscribers, which have been steadily growing.Blame streaming services like Netflix (ticker: NFLX) or Amazon’s (AMZN) Prime Video, which has been stealing TV viewers in recent years. For sports, news, and other live-event coverage, viewers have found streaming options in Alphabet’s (GOOGL) YouTube TV, Dish Network’s (DISH) Sling, and AT&T (T) TV Now. Those options have led subscribers to cut their cable TV cord in favor of the more flexible, and usually cheaper, streaming services. Hoping to stem that outflow, Verizon (VZ) is now giving its Fios customers the option to add or drop TV bundles month by month.For years, cable companies tried to discourage cord-cutting by pushing ‘triple play’ or even ‘quad-play’ bundles on their customers—a combination of internet, TV, landline phones, and mobile phone service.Such bundles often come with one-year or two-year contracts and hefty penalties for early termination. The result was greater and more-predictable revenues for the providers, but at lower profit margins than any of the services would command on their own.Now Verizon is taking a new approach. Call it the half-play. Verizon said on Thursday that it would let customers “Mix and Match on Fios,” meaning they can choose their broadband internet and cable TV options separately and adjust them every month. Its internet plans start at 100 Mbps speeds for $39.99 a month, and a TV package with over 125 channels for $50 a month plus set-top box rental. Verizon stock was down 0.3% in Thursday afternoon trading—versus a 0.6% rise for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 0.5% gain for the S&P 500. While investors seemed to take the move as a sign of weakness from Verizon, one analyst sees the change as a positive. “We believe Verizon’s primary objectives are to retain video subs without conceding margin while putting its internet marketing on the best possible footing with the full spectrum of customers,” wrote Bernstein’s Peter Supino on Thursday. “...Critically, Mix and Match’s pricing architecture should not destabilize competition in Fios markets. Verizon/Fios continues to behave like a profit-driven participant in highly concentrated markets.”The half-measure might keep some Fios internet subscribers from doing away with Fios TV entirely for limited time periods, and could mean some incremental revenue at the margins. Verizon already has the fiber-optic cable running to those customers’ homes, and plugging in a TV plan month by month doesn’t constitute a major effort.Without the long-term bundle and associated discount, those potential monthly TV revenues come at wider profit margins as well. Promotional pricing for a two-year contract that includes gigabit-speed internet and the entry-level Fios TV package recently cost $69.99 a month, versus a combined $129.99 on Verizon’s new Mix and Match plan.

U.S. defense stocks have shot ahead of the broad market since the end of 2019. The impetus has been a cycle of attacks between the U.S. and Iran. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump raised hopes that further escalation can be avoided. Have the stocks run their course? In the short term, history says yes. But longer term, defense contractors remain reasonably priced with healthy growth prospects, and their shares provide a useful hedge against geopolitical uncertainty. Stick with them. Barron’s wrote favorably about the outlook for Lockheed Martin (ticker: LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Raytheon (RTN) in a cover story just over a year ago, ahead of U.S. midterm elections. Democrats were poised to win a majority in the House of Representatives, and defense stocks had sold off on fears of cuts to weapons programs. We pointed to the likelihood of elevated spending no matter the midterm outcome, based in part on disruptive new warfare technologies like hypersonic missiles. Hold that thought. E=EstimateSource: BloombergA spending deal that became law in December gives $738 billion to the Department of Defense in 2020, up $22 billion from last year. Since our story, Lockheed stock has returned 42%, including dividends; Northrop, 37%; Raytheon, 28%; and the S&P 500 index, 23%. In a report on Tuesday, UBS analyst Myles Walton looked at attacks involving the U.S. military in recent decades, like Operation Infinite Reach, a 1998 Navy strike on al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, and the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in a Yemeni harbor. He found that defense stocks tended to rise 4% to 6% within three months. This year through Jan. 6, a basket of six defense stocks—the three aforementioned ones, plus L3Harris Technologies (LHX), Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), and General Dynamics (GD)—gained an average of 6%. That period covers the market’s response to a Dec. 31 attack on the U.S. embassy in Iraq, and to the U.S. killing of Iran’s top general with a drone strike last week, but not to Iran on Tuesday launching ballistic missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq, with no U.S. casualties reported so far. “Given the relative move since Dec. 31, the event contribution to performance may have played out,” wrote Walton. But he also points out that the outlook for defense spending remains strong. and that defense stocks have beaten the market in the year leading up to nine out of the past 10 presidential elections, by an average of 16 percentage points. During a Wednesday address, Trump gave no signal of further escalation. “Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world,” he said. The S&P 500 jumped. Some defense stocks dipped. The president’s comments included a mention of heavy funds being allocated to defense, and a reference to one specific technology. “Under construction are many hypersonic missiles,” he said. That echoes an announcement from Russia’s state media near the end of last year that the country had put such weapons into service. Hypersonic missiles provide cruise-missile maneuverability at five or more times the speed of sound. Picture the precision of a 550 mile-per-hour Tomahawk missile, but travelling upward of 4,000 mph. Such weapons can bypass missile-defense systems and counter the ability of naval fleets to project force. They are an example of highly disruptive technologies that could spur a new arms race among the U.S., China, and Russia. The spending outlook suggests that investors should stick with U.S. defense contractors as long as valuations remain reasonable. Lockheed recently traded at 17.2 times projected 2020 earnings; Northrop, 16 times; and Raytheon, 17.5 times. The companies are seen growing earnings at rates ranging from 9% to 15% a year through 2021—probably well ahead of earnings for the broader stock market.

The market’s best-performing stock last year still has more upside, according to Mizuho Securities. Advanced Micro Devices (ticker: AMD) makes processors that act as the main computing brains for personal computers, servers, and graphics cards. The chip maker’s stock rose 148% last year. That performance ranked number one for the entire S&P 500 index for 2019, according to FactSet.On Wednesday, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh raised his rating for AMD shares to Buy from Neutral, predicting big share gains for its chips this year. He also increased his price target for the stock to $55 from $38. “We believe AMD is well positioned and has significant opportunity to capitalize on Intel’s. ..missteps,” he wrote. AMD stock rose 4.2% to $49.84 on Thursday. The analyst predicts AMD’s processors will do well later this year. He estimates the chip maker’s server market share will rise to 9.1% at year-end versus 4.8% last year. Rakesh is also optimistic over the company’s chip business with gaming console makers— Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SNE). “We see significant opportunities, with coming 2H20E [second-half 2020] console launches from Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X,” he wrote. Last July, the chip maker launched its latest lineup of 7-nanometer (nm) processors that have gained traction in the marketplace. Its main competitor Intel (INTC) primarily offers 14nm desktop chips. Smaller-nanometer manufacturing processes have historically allowed semiconductor companies to create faster, more power-efficient chips.

 Apple stock climbed to record highs on Thursday as iPhone shipments in China jumped more than 18% in December.The tech giant shipped around 3.2 million phones in China last month, according to Chinese government data and Barron’s calculations. That was an 18% rise on the previous year, according to Reuters.Mobile phone shipments in China fell 6.2%, according to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, but Apple iPhones enjoyed a double digit rise.Apple’s stock (ticker: AAPL) climbed 2.1% to $309.54 in early trading on Thursday.The stock jumped 1.6% to a record close of $303.19 on Wednesday, hitting a peak of $304.44 along the way as the company reported that App Store customers spent $1.42 billion between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve. New Year’s Day saw a record single-day spend of $386 million. The data rounded off an impressive 2019 for the firm, which was also buoyed by strong fourth quarter results led by AirPods sales.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the China data added to its bullish thesis on Apple in 2020 and has a price target of $350 in the next twelve months.He said Apple would continue its upward trajectory through its performance in China and that the 5G super cycle would further help the stock.“Many investors are asking us: Is all the good news baked into shares after an historic upward move over the last year? The answer from our vantage point is a resounding no,” he said. Jefferies analyst Kyle McNealy increased his target price to $350 with an upside scenario of $380 ahead of the company’s next quarterly earnings later this month.“Our analysis of foot traffic to retail stores and web traffic to online stores globally shows that Apple is set for a strong finish to calendar 2019.”He added: “We’re removing tariffs from the model, keeping our iPhone unit estimates unchanged and still expect a positive bias for Apple’s December results.”Earlier this week Apple got a downgrade from Needham analyst Laura Martin, who cited the stock’s outperformance in 2019.

 HP Inc. once again has rejected the $22-a-share unsolicited takeover bid from Xerox Holdings as too low. Earlier this week, Xerox (ticker: XRX) announced that it has lined up financing for the cash portion of its offer for the rival printer company, which consists of $17 a share and the remainder in Xerox shares. But HP (HPQ) on Wednesday said its board continues to find the Xerox bid inadequate. “We reiterate that the HP Board of Directors’ focus is on driving sustainable long-term value for HP shareholders,” HP CEO Enrique Lores and Chairman Chip Bergh wrote Wednesday in a letter to Xerox CEO John Visentin. “Your letter dated January 6, 2020 regarding financing does not address the key issue—that Xerox’s proposal significantly undervalues HP—and is not a basis for discussion. The HP Board of Directors remains committed to advancing the best interests of all HP shareholders and to pursuing the most value-creating opportunities.” Xerox initially made the offer to HP in November, and HP has repeatedly rejected it as both too low and too risky given the substantial borrowings Xerox would require to complete the proposed transaction.The question for Xerox is whether it is prepared to launch a proxy contest for control of the HP board ahead—or to launch a hostile tender offer. HP shares were up 0.6% in recent trading, at $21.06, after closing up 1.3% on Wednesday. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% in recent trading. Write to Eric J.

There aren’t many women running enterprise software companies, which makes Thursday morning’s news from Talend (TLND), a cloud data integration company, all the more notable. Talend, based in Redwood City, Calif, went public in 2016 at $18 a share, and recently traded around $42. While the company’s revenue is growing about 20% a year, the company generally operates under the radar. Not today. This morning, Talend named Christal Bemont, who had been the chief revenue officer at SAP Concur, as chief executive officer, effective immediately. She succeeds Mike Tuchen, who will remain on the company’s board. In an interview with Barron’s, Tuchen says that Talend spent a year searching for a chief revenue officer who could eventually be promoted into the CEO role. He said that interviews with Bemont showed she was ready for the top job, no apprenticeship required. The company decided to name her CEO instead.What makes the appointment all the more unusual is that Bemont is bringing along two key members of her team from Concur, an expense management software company. Ann-Christel Graham will become Talend’s chief revenue officer while Jamie Kiser has been named chief customer officer. The changes come with Tuchen’s approval. He notes that after growing Talend’s revenues about five times over the last six years and taking the company through its initial public offering, he’s ready to slow down. Bemont spent 15 years at Concur, joining years before the company’s 2014 acquisition by SAP. Graham has been at the company for more than 20 years; most recently she was vice president of sales for enterprise clients at Concur. Kiser was VP of global public sector for Concur.Bemont said Talend’s situation reminded her of the early years at Concur—with an opportunity for significant growth. “I really appreciate the position Mike and the team put the company in,” Bemont said in an interview with Barron’s. “After I had the initial conversation, I shared the news with my colleagues. It became viral and infectious—it struck a chord with all of us very quickly.”Talend also said it now expects to report fourth quarter revenue of $66.5 million to $67.0 million, versus prior guidance of $65.4 million to $66.4 million.

Traditional dividend havens such as utilities and real estate investment trusts are expected to continue that role, with yields in the 3% range this year. Those looking for more robust dividend growth should consider sectors such as health care and technology. The health and tech sectors in the S&P 500 index are expected to notch the best dividend growth this year on a per share basis, 10% for health care and 9% for tech, according to consensus estimates. Those two sectors are expected to increase their earnings this year by roughly 10%, compared with mid-single digits for utilities and REITs. IHS Markit, a financial-data firm, expects U.S. dividends paid out to total a record $663 billion this year, up 7.2% from 2019’s levels—but below the 7.9% gain the previous year. That 2020 estimate, which excludes special dividends, covers the entire U.S. stock market, including the S&P 500.These are consensus estimates. *Estimated growth compared to previous year.Sources: Bloomberg, FactSet,Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchThe slower dividend growth “is mainly attributed to a slowdown in earnings growth when compared with 2018 earnings growth, which was boosted by tax cuts,” IHS Markit says in its 2020 forecast. Still, there should be plenty of dividend growth this year across various sectors, starting with health care. Dividends usually grow in line with earnings, and the health-care sector, from large pharmaceutical firms to a major prescription-drug distributor, offers plenty of strength. “The amount of money spent on prescription drugs has nearly doubled over the past three decades as pharmaceuticals sales and profit margins have ballooned,” the forecast says.The consensus earnings estimate for the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (ticker: XLV), a good proxy for larger health-care companies, is $6.31 a share, up 8% from $5.82 in 2019.In its recent assessment of dividend trends, IHS Markit noted that the health-care sector “has shown a very aggressive capital deployment stance in [fiscal-year 2019] with mergers and acquisitions being the top priority followed by rising cash dividends.”IHS Markit expects the sector to boost its dividends by 9.3%, helped by sustainable free cash flow and lower debt levels. Goldman Sachs shares IHS Markit’s optimistic outlook for health-care dividend stocks. For analytical purposes, Goldman divides the broad market into various baskets of stocks, one of which focuses on dividend growth. That particular basket, Goldman Sachs wrote in a note dated Jan. 3, “offers longer-term investors a premium yield while positioning for a value rotation.” Growth stocks have outperformed value names for many years, though value stocks did better in the last four months of 2019. Goldman Sachs observed in the research note that “the outlook for growth and value remains muddy” as stand-alone investments, and that “we recommend strategies that combine growth and value.” Goldman’s dividend-growth basket of stocks was recently yielding 3.6%, compared with 2.1% for the S&P 500, and it traded at a substantial discount to the broader market. These stocks offer 10% dividend growth through next year, compared with 5% for the broader market, Goldman Sachs says. The health-care stocks in the basket are AbbVie (ABBV), which recently yielded 5.3%; Gilead Sciences (GILD), 3.9%; Pfizer (PFE), 3.9%; Cardinal Health (CAH), 3.9%; Amgen (AMGN), 2.7%; Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), 2.8%; and Eli Lilly (LLY), 2.2%. Meanwhile, the tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to increase their dividends by an average of 9% on a per-share basis, based on consensus estimates. IHS Markit notes that “many of the leading tech payers have relatively large cash balances and low debt profiles, reinforcing the sector’s status as top payer.” That includes Microsoft (MSFT), which has regularly increased its dividend at a double-digit pace, and Apple (AAPL), whose net cash at the end of September totaled $98 billion. Microsoft was recently yielding 1.3%, and Apple was at 1%—both well below the S&P 500’s average of about 2%.The yields of Microsoft and Apple are also punier than the tech stocks in the Goldman Sachs dividend-growth basket. But in terms of total dividend payouts expected this year, Microsoft and Apple are expected to rank in the top five of U.S. companies, according to IHS Markit.The tech names in Goldman’s dividend-growth basket include Texas Instruments (TXN), which recently yielded 2.8%; IBM (IBM), 4.8%; Broadcom (AVGO), 4.2%; Cisco Systems (CSCO), 3%; and NetApp (NTAP), 3.1%.Of course, health care and tech aren’t the only sectors that offer dividend growth. Based on consensus estimates, consumer-discretionary and energy companies in the S&P 500 are expected to boost their dividends this year by 8% on average. Consider, though, that the Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR exchange-traded fund (XLY), a proxy for companies in that sector, yields about 1.3%—not all that enticing. And energy stocks have lagged behind the broader market, their attractive yields notwithstanding. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) was recently yielding about 3.7%.Utilities in the S&P 500 are expected to boost their dividends on a per share basis by an average of 7%, a respectable gain if it occurs. However, many of these stocks have been bid up, as investors seek yield in a low-rate environment, essentially treating them as a bond proxy. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU), for example, trades at about 19.7 forward earnings estimates, some 15% above its five-year average of 17.2 times, according to FactSet.Income investors could also turn to the financial, materials, and industrial sectors of the S&P 500 for yield growth. Such stocks are expected to boost their dividends by 6% this year on a per share basis, according to consensus estimates. Take financials, for instance. They are expected to yield 2.2% on average, and many individual banks sport even higher yields. JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM) was recently at 2.6%, the same as Citigroup’s (C). Wells Fargo (WFC) was at 3.8%, compared with a 2.1% yield for Bank of America (BAC).Although dividend growth should slow this year, there should still be plenty of yield available in various sectors. But it’s important to understand the fundamentals of a company, even if its yield is alluring. • Write to Lawrence C.

 Grubhub stock jumped 17% on Wednesday afternoon after The Wall Street Journal reported the company is looking at strategic options, including a possible sale. The news also sent shares of Uber Technologies (ticker: UBER), parent of Uber Eats and one of Grubhub’s largest rivals, higher. Uber’s shares were up as much as 4.7% in afternoon trading. A Grubhub (GRUB) spokeswoman told Barron’s that “we do not comment on market rumors or speculation.”The food-delivery business is booming, but competition has made it difficult to make money. Four big competitors—Uber, Grubhub, and privately owned Postmates and DoorDash—are fighting for market share, dangling deals in front of customers and restaurants to encourage sign-ups. Those four companies collectively controlled more than 95% of third-party food delivery business, according to analysts at Gordon Haskett. Grubhub stock fell 37% in 2019 and was recently trading around $50 after nearly hitting $150 in late 2018. Analysts polled by FactSet expect that its earnings fell to 80 cents per share in 2019 from $1.66 in 2018.Grubhub was once the clear market leader in food delivery, but recent numbers indicate it may have been passed by DoorDash. Gordon Haskett calculates Doordash’s market share at 32% and Grubhub’s at 31.9% in a report from May 2019. Grubhub works with more than 140,000 restaurants, serving more than 21 million “active diners” in the third quarter of last year. With an enterprise value around $4.7 billion, it wouldn’t be an outrageous acquisition for a competitor like Uber, which is worth over $50 billion. Investors have been expecting consolidation in the industry, which would likely allow the remaining companies to raise prices.“The odds of consolidation are quite high,” Mario Cibelli, manager of hedge fund Marathon Partners Equity Management said in a recent interview with Barron’s. “Likely, you will eventually have two dominant players.”Grubhub recently told Barron’s that it had the most sustainable business model in the industry, and is the only delivery service “that has grown without unsustainable shortcuts like incurring massive operating losses, offering irrational diner pricing, and giving drivers substantial subsidies.” Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com~technology~GrubHub~2020-01-08~Shares of the food delivery firm rose as much as 17% Wednesday following a report that the company might be for sale.~GrubHub,GRUB,Uber Technologies,UBER,financial performance,share price movement,disruptions,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,companies,technology,us,lodgings,restaurants,bars,cafes,fast food places,caterers,mobile food services,e-commerce,online service providers,leisure,arts,hospitality,sharing,on-demand economy services~Why a Grubhub Merger Could Solve Food Delivery’s Woes ~https://www.barrons.com/articles/grubhub-stock-jumps-on-merger-talk-51578510006?mod=hp_LEAD_1~2020
 Microsoft stock has higher to go even after its stunning recent rally, says Morgan Stanley. The company’s shares (ticker: MSFT) have risen more than 50% over the past year amid enthusiasm over the company’s Azure cloud-computing business and its success in selling subscriptions for software such as Office 365.On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated his Overweight rating for Microsoft stock. He raised his price target for the shares to $189 from $157. “Strong positioning for ramping public cloud adoption, large distribution channels and installed customer base, and improve margins support a path well beyond $1 trillion market cap for Microsoft,” he wrote. Microsoft shares rose 1.5% to $159.98 on Wednesday. Its market cap is $1.2 trillion, according to FactSet. The analyst noted Microsoft may be the best cloud provider for corporations that need to use and integrate both the public cloud and on-premise server computing.In late October, Microsoft beat earnings expectations for its September quarter, citing its cloud segment. “The world’s leading companies are choosing our cloud to build their digital capability,” CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement at the time.Microsoft is winning big cloud-computing deals too. Late last year, the Defense Department said Microsoft was awarded a cloud-computing contract worth up to $10 billion over 10 years if all options are exercised.

Beneath the surface of the CES trade show in Las Vegas this week, where thousands of connected devices are on display, there are serious questions about the way technology companies use consumer data—and the way government regulates the use of that information.That topic was the subject of a much-anticipated roundtable Tuesday afternoon at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The panelists at the event included Erin Egan, VP of Public Policy and Chief Privacy Officer for Facebook (ticker: FB); Jane Horvath, senior director of global privacy at Apple (AAPL); Susan Shook, global privacy officer at Procter & Gamble (PG); and Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic appointee to the Federal Trade Commission. The moderator for the discussion was Rajeev Chard, partner and head of research at Wing Venture Capital.Slaughter spent the session asking whether tech companies are doing enough to protect consumer privacy. Almost every day, she says, there are media reports about privacy issues and breaches. “It would be impossible to conclude that enough is being done,” she said. Slaughter agrees with FTC Chairman Joe Simons, who told a CES crowd on Tuesday that Congress should pass a strong federal privacy law, given the risk of conflicting rules in multiple states—and to ensure consistent enforcement and practice.Apple’s Horvath (who spent the session fighting a losing battle with laryngitis) asserted that Apple focused on privacy in the design of its products. Early in the design process, she says, Apple assigns a privacy lawyer and privacy engineer to every product. “We always have to be pushing the envelope on how we are going to put the consumer in control of their data,” Horvath said.Facebook’s Egan was on the defensive for most of the session. She noted that Facebook recently launched a private check up tool to allow users to see who is seeing your personal data and how they’re using it. And P&G’s Shook says that they are “trying to champion a consumer-centric privacy framework,” giving consumers choice on how their data is used, allowing them to disengage, and to make sure P&G is a strong steward of customer data.But the FTC’s Slaughter says she’s concerned about a world in which the burden to protect data lies with the consumer. “The amount of information you have to process to find out what is happening with your data is untenable,” she says, not even counting what third parties are doing with the data that’s been shared with them. Slaughter says the burden should be placed on collectors and stewards of data to minimize the data collected, kept, and shared, “without creating endless troves of data that disappear into the ether.”Horvath outlined a number of steps Apple takes to protect consumer data, like injecting data into certain data sets to make it harder to identify individuals and shifting more processing to devices, out of the cloud. She also says Apple has taken steps to allow people to sync their device for sensitive data like photos without directly sharing the data with Apple.Egan emphasized that Facebook has a different business model than Apple, but that they absolutely do not want to place burdens on the consumer. And she says that, like Apple, Facebook is committed to building privacy into its products.Asked about the concept of “surveillance capitalism,” Egan said she takes issue with the idea that the ads Facebook serves are a form of surveillance. “People are deriving value from advertising business models,” she says. “We believe there is value in free services.”On the idea that people are manipulated by online advertising, Egan said that “we don’t want to be manipulating anybody; that’s not our business model.” She also says that Facebook “embodies data minimization,” collecting only the data they need to serve people relevant advertising, and deleting information after a period of retention.Asked whether as a general matter that consumer privacy is protected in the current landscape, Slaughter expressed doubts. “I don’t think privacy is generally protected,” she says. “No one in this room can tell me who has what data about them and how it is being used...the question is what is the minimum amount of data that can be collected, shared, and used without them being harmed.” Write to Eric J.

Has Apple stock gone too far, too fast? The stock has doubled since the start of 2019, and is already up close to 8% in 2020.Driving the stock higher has been anticipation of a rebound in iPhone sales when the first 5G models are launched later this year, as well better-than-expected iPhone 11 demand and enthusiasm about the company’s services and wearables segments. But with expectations so high, there is little room for error.Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell says the market’s enthusiasm for Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) has gotten out of hand. Corwell cut his rating on Apple shares this morning to Underweight from Neutral, while actually lifting his price target to $275 from $235. He says the upside from the 5G cycle is now “more than priced in” to the stock, and contends iPhone 11 sales could still prove disappointing. And he says services and wearables “are unlikely to be a source of material upside.”Cordwell actually thinks the Street is underestimating the earnings power of the coming iPhone cycle—his profit estimate for the September 2021 fiscal year is $16.25 a share, above Street consensus at $15.06. But the stock’s multiple expansion in the current run has been greater than the previous booms associated with the launches of iPhone 6 and iPhone X, he writes. There is also still risk “5G may disappoint” as a catalyst for the stock. The London-based analyst asserts that even based on his above-consensus fiscal year 2021 estimate, “the stock has overshot to the upside.”Cordwell finds that most of the company’s services gross profit comes not from newer services, such as credit cards and streaming, but instead from the App Store and Google traffic acquisition cost (TAC) payments for search services on Safari. Both of those streams are “maturing,” and an upside surprise is unlikely in that segment, he writes. On wearables, AirPod and Apple Watch could drive continued momentum, but neither is big enough to make a major difference, he says.Finally, on iPhone 11, he writes that price pressure could still result in disappointing revenue, while the 5G rollout in China could “leave Apple still challenged” in 2020 as other phone makers start rolling out 5G phones before Apple does. “Admittedly, the stock has outperformed during prior periods of significant upward earnings revisions, meaning our call could be early,” Cordwell writes, “but we believe it is prudent to now be Underweight given the recent run and potential for future iPhone 11 or 5G iPhone-related disappointments.”Apple stock was recently down 0.7% to $314.81 on Tuesday.

 Tesla stock has more upside after hitting a record Tuesday because Wall Street continues to underestimate the company’s earnings power and auto production, according to a former Wall Street tobacco analyst and bull on the shares. Tesla (ticker TSLA), whose shares rose $17.52 to $469.06 Tuesday, now has a market value of nearly $85 billion, almost as much as the combined $87 billion market capitalization of Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM). Gary Black, a leading tobacco analyst for Bernstein in the 1990s and the former chief executive of Aegon Asset Management, isn’t fazed by Tesla’s rising market value. “Amazon skeptics asked the same question when AMZN had $85 billion market cap. How could AMZN be worth more than Nordstrom, Kohl’s, Macy’s and Target combined? When a disruptive technology takes out existing competitors, the market discounts all future profits,” Black tweeted Tuesday. He sees Tesla’s U.S. market share rising to 10% in 2024 from 2% now. Black is now a private investor. Black said in December that Tesla stock, then around $400, could double. In his latest series of tweets, Black said Tesla’s market value is justifiable, writing that the “stock market is a discounting mechanism—looks forward not back.” He thinks Tesla’s annual net income will be $5 billion by 2024 and $15 billion by 2029, against a combined $11 billion annually for Ford and GM now and heading lower.Black’s view is Tesla’s earnings per share could hit $10 a share in 2020, against a consensus estimate of around $5 a share, and $27 a share in 2024. At a price-to-earnings ratio of 30, the 2024 earnings would support a stock price of $800 a share. Black thinks that Tesla may set 2020 auto production guidance of 500,000 when it reports fourth-quarter results on Jan. 29, against a Wall Street consensus of 470,000.

 Apple stock soared to new highs Thursday following reports that December iPhone shipments in China had risen by about 18% from 2018.While positive, that may not be the full picture, given this year’s differences in launch timing and pricing. In fact, an analyst at Credit Suisse estimates iPhone revenue in China fell 23% for the last three months of 2019. The back story. Apple stock’s (AAPL) gain of 86% led the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2019. That optimism stems partly from its growing services and wearables businesses, as well as the belief its iPhone 11 is selling better than expected. Read more: Barron’s Roundtable: Almost No Chance of a Recession But Apple’s run up to more than $312 has left even some bullish analysts in the dust, with lower price targets than current levels. That means it was time for bulls to raise price targets even higher or adjust their ratings accordingly.The stock rose on Thursday after data from the Chinese government said Apple shipped 3.2 million phones in December, an 18% jump from December 2018. That news came as overall mobile phone shipments in the country fell 6.2%. What's new. Credit Suisse analyst Matthew Cabral called the data a significant improvement from drops in October in November, though December 2018 was an easier comparison to beat. He did write that by taking into account 2018’s staggered iPhone launch by looking at cumulative shipments over September to December, units in China were actually down 3.2% in 2019. He also notes that about 70% of the newly launched units in China during the quarter ending in September were the lower-priced iPhone 11 model. Taking that into account, along with price cuts this year, he estimates China iPhone revenue was down 23% in the last three months of the year. Looking Ahead. Cabral has a Neutral rating on the stock, though he did raise his price target to $275, up from $221.With his estimate for calendar fourth-quarter revenue in China to decline 23%, growth outside of China will be needed for the company to hit his total iPhone revenue estimate of $50.9 billion. “We remain Neutral, as we need greater line-of-sight to upward EPS momentum (particularly Services-led) to justify the stock’s increasingly premium multiple,” he wrote.Apple stock was up 0.4% to $310.80 Friday, while the S&P 500 index was up 0.1%.

 Amazon. com stock came up short in 2019.Amazon stock (ticker: AMZN) rose 23% in 2019, but that gain was in the shadow of the S&P 500’s 28.9% rise. The index is essentially a proxy for the market in general, and it serves as a benchmark of passive investing. The retail giant’s shares were hemmed in by a summer swoon, and disappointing numbers in the fall. Barron’s is bullish on the stock’s prospects, however, and we have branded Amazon stock as a “free-cash rocket ship.”One of Amazon’s newest directors continues to buy stock. Former PepsiCo (PEP) Chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi paid $187,500 on Jan. 2 for 100 Amazon shares, an average price of $1,875.00 each. Nooyi purchased the stock through an automated trading plan. She now owns 350 Amazon shares in a personal account and an additional 18 shares in a trust, according to a form Nooyi filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Read more: Barron’s Roundtable: Almost No Chance of a Recession It is Nooyi’s second purchase through her trading plan since she joined Amazon’s board in February 2019. On Oct. 4, she paid $172,606 for 100 Amazon shares, an average per-share price of $1,726.06. Amazon declined to make Nooyi available for comment on her latest stock purchase.Nooyi is the only Amazon insider to buy stock on the open market since January 2012, when director Jonathan Rubenstein paid $12,052 for 68 shares, an average per-share price of $177.23.Company executives and directors use trading plans to remove any potential bias they may have from the knowledge of material nonpublic information about their company. The insiders set parameters, such as price and volume, for the so-called Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and when the conditions are met, transactions are automatically executed. Many insiders use such plans to sell stock, but trading plans can also be used to purchase shares.We have noted that Amazon stock has averaged an annual 35% gain, compounded, since going public. Using that yardstick, 2019’s performance was also relatively weak. We have told investors not to expect a 35% rise in 2020, but we aren’t ruling it out, either.

 International Business Machines stock is trading modestly lower Monday after an analyst downgrade.Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani reduced his rating on IBM stock (ticker: IBM) to In Line from Outperform, while trimming his price target on the tech giant’s shares to $145 from $160. His view: Street revenue estimates are too high given a backdrop of soft enterprise technology spending.The analyst writes in a research note that IBM faces a combination of both “macro headwinds” and a “difficult” second-half setup “that warrants incremental caution.”With IBM due to report fourth-quarter results next week, he sees risk to guidance given a backdrop of cautious comments on enterprise sales from peers such as Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Dell Technologies (DELL).Daryanani also worries that consensus revenue estimates calling for IBM to grow 2020 revenue by 3% could be too high—he notes that would suggest organic growth of 1% to 2% not counting the company’s recent Red Hat acquisition, a level he thinks is optimistic given peer comments on the industry.Street consensus calls for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $4.69 on revenue of $21.64 billion. For all of 2020, the Street consensus estimates are for EPS of $13.31 on revenue of $79.5 billion. The Evercore analyst models fourth-quarter EPS of $4.70 on revenue of $21.54 billion, and for 2020, EPS of $13.20 on revenue of $79.2 billion.Daryanani also comments that higher net leverage after the Red Hat deal limits the company’s ability to repurchase shares “and could keep investors at bay.”While IBM remains an “appealing asset” given growth in the market for hybrid cloud computing, and a dividend yield above 4%, “skewed expectations” for the fourth quarter and 2020 “create downside risk to Street estimates and keep the stock rangebound.”IBM stock in early trading Monday is down 0.7%, to $135.80.

 Pinterest shares are soaring to their highest level since Halloween after the market research firm eMarketer wrote in a Tuesday blog post that Pinterest has surpassed Snap unit Snapchat in users to become the third-largest U.S. social-media platform, behind only Facebook and its sister site Instagram.According to eMarketer, Pinterest (ticker: PINS) had 82.4 million users in 2019, up 9.1% from 75.5 million in 2018, and ahead of Snapchat at 80.2 million users, which was up 5.9% from 75.8 million in 2018. The market research firm expects Pinterest to grow its user base faster than Snapchat from here. By 2022, eMarketer expects Pinterest to have 90.1 million U.S. users, with 86.1 million for Snapchat. The firm said that while Snapchat has “a young core audience that it caters to,” Pinterest has “a more universal appeal” and has made gained traction in a wide range of age groups.Pinterest declined to comment on the eMarketer report. Snapchat didn’t respond to a request for comment.Note that eMarketer’s calculations aren’t quite apples to apple with the reported data from either Pinterest or Snap. In disclosing third-quarter financial results in October, Pinterest said it had 87 million monthly active users in the September quarter, up 8% from the comparable year-earlier period. Snap reported 84 million active users in North America at the end of the same period.Asked about the discrepancy, eMarketer said in a statement that the firm’s estimates of monthly active users are often below those reported by companies. The firm said it uses survey data to weed out multiple accounts from single users, fake accounts, nonhuman accounts (from pets, businesses, and bots), and “non-user initiated contact with the company’s database that logs activity as if there was active use when there was not.”Pinterest went public last April at $19 a share and has had a lackluster run in the public markets. While the stock traded close to $37 briefly over the summer, almost double the IPO price, the gains were fleeting. The stock was crushed after reporting disappointing third-quarter financial results and softer-than-expected fourth-quarter guidance on Oct. 31. By year end, spooked investors had driven the stock to $18.64, slightly below the IPO price.Pinterest shares Tuesday were up 8.9%, at $21.36, in recent trading.

 Earnings in Focus. Stocks ended the day with mixed results, with all three major indexes finishing not far from the flat line. Corporate earnings came into focus this week, led by major banks and Delta Air Lines (ticker: DAL). A day ahead of the signing of an initial U.S.-China trade deal, the Treasury Department officially dropped the “currency manipulator” label against China. At the same time, the House will vote on Wednesday to send the impeachment charges against President Donald Trump to the Senate, which expects to start the trial next Tuesday.

Bully for Banks All three major indexes closed in the black on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 32.62 points, or 0.11%, to close at 28,939.67. The S&P 500 slipped 4.98 points, or 0.15%, to end at 3283.15, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 22.60 points, or 0.24%, to close at 9251.33.Big banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with an upbeat note. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) stock both rose on Tuesday after the banks posted earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. The strong growth was fueled by their investment banking units as well as a surge in fixed-income trading. Consumer trends and credit quality also remain positive for the banking industry. At the same time, Wells Fargo stock (WFC) tumbled after a disappointing report. This is the first earnings report under the bank’s new CEO Charles Scharf, who was brought in last year to fix the embattled bank.The consumer-price index rose 0.2% in December, the government said on Tuesday, slightly below the consensus forecast for a 0.3% advance. With the final month’s data in, consumer inflation for all of 2019 reached 2.3%, up from the 12-months inflation figure of 2.1% as of November. The 12-months rate hit the highest mark since October 2018, but it is still quite low by historical standards. If inflation remains under control in 2020, the Federal Reserve will likely stay put and not raise interest rates. Low rates should help the economy to expand for an 11th straight year, continuing a record run. Another important inflation gauge, the producer-price index, will be released on Wednesday. Economists are expecting a 0.3% rise from the prior month. Chinese exports in December unexpectedly rose 7.6% from the year-ago period, much stronger than a consensus estimate for growth of 2.9%, and marking the country’s first increase in exports since March. Boosted by China’s renewed purchases of U.S. pork and soybeans, overall imports for the country rose 16.3%, well beyond the consensus of 9.6%, and November’s 0.3% increase.Still, for the full year, Chinese total exports only increased 0.5% in 2019, down sharply from the 9.9% growth in 2018. With the “phase one” trade deal to be signed soon, many are expecting the U.S. to roll back some existing tariffs and China to purchase more American farm products. In that case, the trade activities between the two countries should pick up again.However, a report on Tuesday said that existing tariffs on Chinese imports would likely stay in place until after the U.S. elections and any reduction would depend on Chinese compliance with the new agreement.

Investors experiencing the fear of missing out, or FOMO, can still buy Tesla shares if they think that global sales of electric vehicles are at an inflection point. Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock has been on an incredible run since the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings in late October. Shares are up more than 100% over the past three months, crushing comparable returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. Tesla shares were up 3.2% Tuesday afternoon to more than $540.It would be understandable if investors watching from the sidelines are feeling as if they missed out on the next big thing. What’s more, those without a stake in Tesla might be reluctant to buy at current levels, thinking that would be a recipe for portfolio disaster. No one wants to buy high and sell low. But, as one portfolio manager—an off-again, on-again Tesla shareholder—told Barron’s, investors can still buy in, so long as they believe in the long-term prospects for the company. They key is to manage risk. And risk with a stock as volatile as Tesla can be mitigated by position size. Tesla shares are about twice as volatile as, say, Apple (AAPL) stock. Investors can buy a very small position, then add to it when shares dip and sell some when shares rise. Investors don’t have to take an all-or-nothing view with any portfolio position. And keeping some stock forces an investor to maintain focus on the business fundamentals. It also cures FOMO. On the flip side, short sellers have to have an iron stomach to say short Tesla stock these days. Bearish investing pros can go “short” by borrowing and selling shares, betting on near-term price declines. But the Tesla short isn’t working, to say the least. The recent rally is, in industry parlance, ripping the face off the shorts. In fact, Tesla has been tough for short sellers for a while. Data analytics provider S3 estimates short sellers have lost more than $11 billion since 2016 betting against the company and its enigmatic CEO, Elon Musk. But the short sellers are still there. “Tesla is the second largest short in the domestic market behind Apple,” S3 wrote in a Tuesday research report. S3 is talking in absolute terms—the amount of money sold short. About $13 billion worth of Tesla shares are shorted, according to S3. That is almost 13% of its market value. Apple, however, is more than 13 times the size of Tesla measured by market capitalization. Only about 1% of Apple shares available for trading are sold short. It is a tiny amount, relatively speaking. There are, essentially, no Apple bears in the marketplace. By comparison, about 20% of Tesla shares available for trading are sold short, and there are plenty of Tesla bears. High short interest can lead to a short squeeze—when bearish investors rush to cover positions en masse. Short covering is one explantation for the magnitude of the recent Tesla rally. But that isn’t the only factor driving shares higher. “It’s a short squeeze, but also real buying on a global EV inflection point,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in an interview. With China growing, electric vehicles will constitute 8% of global auto sales by 2024, up from 3% today, he said. “That’s the key for Musk and Fremont.” (Fremont, Calif., is where Tesla has its headquarters.)Ives sees bullish Tesla investors trimming positions as the stock price rises. But he said there are other investors “doubling down on a China Tesla thesis.” The company just started delivering Model 3 sedans produced in China for the Chinese market. The lower price point for the Model 3—versus the Model X or Model S vehicles—along with local tax and EV incentives in the country should help Tesla volumes there in 2020.

Current tariffs on goods imported from China will likely remain in effect until after the November U.S. presidential election, according to a Bloomberg News report. The media outlet cited people familiar with the matter. It also said any action to lower the tariffs will depend on China’s compliance with the “phase-one” trade agreement. The U.S. currently has tariffs on roughly $360 billion of imports from China.The S&P 500 index dropped from its highs to roughly flat on Tuesday after the report.The U.S. and China are set to sign the “phase-one” agreement on Wednesday. Earlier this week, Barron’s suggested while trade war concerns may have receded for the short term, investors shouldn’t be confident that the ups and downs in the Beijing-Washington relationship are going away.

The thorn in Beijing’s side inched its way in further. The small island of Taiwan, which rules itself as a democracy but which China claims as a runaway territory, re-elected its liberal, “anti-China” president, Tsai Ing-wen. Her victory was widely expected—but only recently. This time last year her China-friendly opponent was ahead in the polls and support for his party was strong.Tsai’s turnaround corresponded with Hong Kong’s year of unrest. Unrest that infuriated Beijing and provoked rhetoric from China that reminded many across the world—but especially in Taiwan and Hong Kong—that the Communist Party considers democracy a nuisance.It’s tough enough to unravel what this says about Taiwan’s domestic politics, but it’s even more complicated to predict what it means for China, and in particular its relationship with the U.S., which continues to provide Taiwan with billions of dollars worth of advanced military equipment each year amid Washington’s biting trade and political tensions with Beijing.Trump has not shied away from other policies that irked China. He spoke by phone with Tsai after his 2016 election win, something no American president or president-elect has done since 1979, when the U.S. switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. American ships have also increased their frequency of patrols through the strait that divides Taiwan and mainland China.This American closeness with Taiwan—but particularly with Tsai’s DPP—has not gone unnoticed by Beijing, which has strongly condemned Washington and ramped up its campaign to lure away Taiwan’s few remaining allies. Most strikingly, Beijing allegedly conducted an extensive disinformation campaign in an attempt to weaken Tsai’s chances—a charge China denies.But China’s clumsy approach to a range of issues—Hong Kong, pressure against Taiwan’s allies, and the disinformation accusations—tracked very neatly with Tsai’s dramatic electoral comeback. Some experts see this is as an embarrassing foreign-policy blunder by Beijing.At the same time, Tsai wasn’t exactly invigorating her base. “There is a lot of dissatisfaction with Tsai among her own supporters (crazy to think that given her historic win), for her pension reform, bungling transitional justice and what they see as an overly moderate response to China,” said Jonathan Sullivan, director of the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham.But that doesn’t change the fact that losing candidate Han Kuo-yu’s KMT party was far more pro-China, and remained so even as Beijing’s actions caused increasing concern.Despite Tsai’s commanding victory, the Taiwanese don’t overwhelmingly love her party, whose distinguishing policy stance is its stronger anti-China position. Significant numbers stuck by the KMT party.“The party numbers were strong enough for the KMT that it infers that the party is not completely lost, nor does it exclude the possibility that if the KMT finds a winning candidate, the party could return,” said Lev Nachman, a Fulbright fellow based in Taiwan. As for the other side, “It’s not that Tsai didn’t win, she most certainly had a major victory. The DPP as a party though, did not have the victory it seems they did,” Nachman said.Saturday’s vote offers a contrast to recent election trends in the U.S. and the U.K. As in those open democracies, a populist candidate gained rapid acceptance and voters faced disinformation campaigns—two trends that had come to be seen as concerning new normals in modern democratic politics.But Taiwan bucked those trends. The colorful Han, whom many compare to Donald Trump, lost his populist luster and voters were skeptical of dubious “news” and political rumors throughout the campaign.This by no means implies that election interference doesn’t work, or that candidates who appeal to voters’ baser instincts haven’t found a shrewd political formula. But Taiwan showed that those tactics may be less of the new normal than believed.The U.S. will offer another case study in November, when Trump, the other thorn in Beijing’s side, seeks reelection. Expect China, populism, and questionable attempts to sway voter sentiment to be key factors to watch.

The past six years have been miserable for oil stocks, and the worst of the bunch have been oil-services companies, which fell 72% between 2014 and 2019. Last year, some investors argued it was time to get back into the sector, because stocks had fallen so much despite oil-services being an important part of the economy. Bernstein analyst Nicholas Green weighed in on Tuesday with an initiation note on oil-services companies, arguing that investors should indeed put money to work in the sector. He said some of the companies offer enormous opportunities to savvy investors.“Oil Services may be only 5% of Oil & Gas market cap, but it sees about 20% of the traded value,” Green wrote. “Poor quality of information means the sector is an active manager’s dream: lots of idiosyncratic alpha, huge dispersions in performance, and huge option value on recovery. See through the fog, and there is a lot of opportunity.”In general, oil-services companies face bleak times. A “double-dip recession” is coming to the sector, as oil-and-gas producers continue to cut back on capital spending. Service activity could drop an additional 20% by 2021, Green projects. And attention to climate change means there isn’t much “pent-up demand” for major oil projects, as some investors seem to expect. The old way of doing business is almost definitely over.Still, there are investment opportunities. Green argues that the big names that attract the most attention and investor dollars aren’t the place to be. Those big names are Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BKR), the three dominant U.S. oil-services companies. Green thinks their valuation is about 25% too high, and management hasn’t explained a clear enough path forward. He also tells investors to avoid Transocean (RIG), Valaris (VAL), Nabors (NBR), McDermott (MDR) and Vallourec (VLOUF), because of concerns about their financial strength.Green sees opportunities elsewhere. His favorite stock is Tenaris (TS), which he says has been unfairly punished because of its exposure to U.S. shale and is 20% undervalued. It also has a 4.8% dividend yield. Green also likes SBM Offshore (SBFFF), which he thinks “could be the safest oil-service company to own in the group. A little should go in every generalist portfolio.” Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com~markets~Schlumberger~2020-01-14~Bernstein analyst Nicholas Green argues that investors should indeed put money to work in the oil-services sector.

The U.K. gambling industry woke Tuesday to a new regulatory clampdown, as the Gambling Commission said that as of April 14, credit cards can’t be used to place off- or online bets.The move follows a joint commission and government review, so wasn’t exactly a surprise. That didn’t stop some initial knee-jerk losses from companies in the firing line— GVC Holdings (ticker: GVC.UK), William Hill (WMH.UK), 888 Holdings (888.UK), Flutter Entertainment (FLTR.UK), and Stockholm-based Evolution Gaming (EVO.Sweden), which derived 13% of its third-quarter revenue from the U.K. Those moves were later mostly recouped. The Commission points out that of an estimated 24 million U.K. adults who gamble, 10.5 million do so online, and 800,000 use credit cards to bet. Some 22% of credit card users are considered “problem gamblers.” The new regulations will require that all online gambling operations take part in GamStop, a self-exclusion plan for U.K. gamblers, as of March. Most companies didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, though spokespeople for William Hill and GVC referred to a statement from industry body The Betting and Gaming Council, which welcomed the latest move and said it’s committed to safer gambling.Peel Hunt analysts Ivor Jones and Douglas Jack noted that operators have generally said they expect only a “marginal impact” from the new rules.”Still, saying anything else would imply knowledge of players spending borrowed money that they cannot afford, which isn’t supposed to be happening anyway. We’ll only know the effect in H2 2020 [the second half of 2020],” they say. Davy Research analysts estimate that U.K. online revenue “represents 22%/31%/31% of GVC/Flutter/William Hill group revenues respectively in 2019F.” And while gambling overall is no longer the opportunity it once was, they say the online side remains a large and “highly cash generative market.” That last part is key for investors—that the online opportunities may still be out there. However, they may need to brace themselves, as the door looks wide open for even more regulatory moves as some anti-gambling campaigners celebrate what they see as a long-overdue victory here.

China is no longer a currency manipulator. The Treasury Department made that announcement Monday. The decision is part of President Trump’s broader agenda on trade. It’s another sign to the market that trade talks with China are going in the right direction, and that is a big reason the U.S. stock market keeps marching higher. “The Treasury Department has helped secure a significant Phase One agreement with China that will lead to greater economic growth and opportunity for American workers and businesses,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the department’s news release. “China has made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation, while promoting transparency and accountability.”Foreign-exchange markets are arcane, often thought of as the domain of suspendered traders sitting in New York, London, and Hong Kong. But currency fluctuations can roil stock markets from time to time. Back in August, for instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was sporting a 3.1% intraday drop, while the S&P 500 was down 3.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite had slumped 3.8%. Those are huge one-day moves in the stock market. The reason? The Chinese currency—the Yuan—broke the level of 7 to the dollar. China was weakening its currency. It was becoming less expensive in terms of the U.S. dollar. The Yuan peaked at about 7.18 to the dollar in August—it took more than 7 Yuan to purchase $1 in the summer. Today, it takes 6.90 Yuan to purchase $1. The difference is less than 4%. It seems small given the large impact it had on stock markets. But currencies can become weapons in the trade war. What’s more, currencies don’t typically fluctuate like stocks.The Yuan is typically quoted in Yuan required to buy $1. The inverse of the quote is how many U.S. dollars it takes to buy one Yuan. It costs about 14.5 cents to purchase one Yuan today. The Chinese currency doesn’t freely float like most currencies. The Chinese government tries to control the price by buying and selling currencies with its foreign-exchange reserves. Weakening the currency had the potential to nullify the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. Import levies, implemented by the current administration, raise the price of goods to American buyers. The weaker currency lowered the price paid by American buyers, offsetting the duties. That’s ultimately why U.S. government officials hackles were raised and what led to the manipulator designation. It was a trade-based decision. China, while no longer designated a manipulator, goes on the list of countries whose currencies the Treasury Department is “monitoring,” including Japan, Korea, Ireland, Germany, Italy, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Switzerland. It’s a long list. But “the monitoring list designation has no formal implications, except possible heavy criticism from the U.S.,” wrote Standard Charter analyst Steve Englander in a Tuesday research report.The U.S. government has indicated that after the phase-one trade deal is signed, it would like to see further Yuan appreciation. A stronger Chinese currency makes U.S. exports less expensive and Chinese imports into the U.S. more expensive. U.S. manufacturers like a weaker dollar, but American consumers tend to like a stronger dollar—it gives them more bang for their buck.“For investors, the question is whether [Yuan appreciation] is a Treasury aspiration for whether China has indicated, as part of the phase one deal, that it will strengthen the [Yuan] as tariffs are removed,” adds Englander.So U.S. investors can follow the currency to infer how U.S.-China trade negotiations are proceeding.

 Wells Fargo’s first earnings report under its new CEO, who was brought in to turn around the troubled bank, fell short of Wall Street’s expectations.The bank reported 93 cents per share in earnings on $19.86 billion in revenue, less than the consensus of $1.12 in EPS and revenue of $20.14 billion. Wells Fargo stock (ticker: WFC) was down 3.6% to $50.25 in premarket trading on Tuesday following the release. Over the past 12 months, Wells’ stock is up 7.6%, compared with a 27% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period. “Wells Fargo is a wonderful and important franchise that has made some serious mistakes, and my mandate is to make the fundamental changes necessary to regain the full trust and respect of all stakeholders,” Charles Scharf, who took over as the bank’s chief executive in late October, said in a statement.The bank’s third-quarter earnings in October, the last under interim CEO Allen Parker, also fell short of analysts’ expectations. Scharf, who previously led Bank of New York Mellon, has a relatively short, if daunting, to-do list. He needs to repair Wells’ relationship with banking regulations and get the Federal Reserve to lift its cap on the bank’s growth, which was put in place because of its poor response to a fake-accounts scandal and other compliance-related shortfalls. He also needs to regain the trust of customers, cut expenses and increase earnings.Some of the tasks might be at odds with each other. For instance, the Fed is no doubt looking for the bank to invest heavily in compliance and control systems and personnel, which could work against efforts to cut costs. If Scharf can get the iconic banking franchise back on track, however, the rewards to investors could be great.

Stocks are taking a pause on their upward trajectory. Futures on the main U.S. stock indexes were flat to lower as the big U.S. banks, and Delta Air Lines, begin reporting their fourth- quarter earnings. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down about 0.2% in overseas trading, while the U.K’.s FTSE 100 Index fell about 0.1%. In the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average was barely in positive territory, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite futures were narrowly in the red.Some stocks are moving more significantly in premarket trading Tuesday. GameStop (ticker: GME) shares have dropped almost 10%. The company reported holiday results: Same-store sales dropped 24.7% year over year. Beyond Meat (BYND) shares are rising again, continuing their wild ride. The stock rose 19% Monday and was up another 5.8% in premarket trading. The reason? It’s tough to find one. The stock is heavily shorted—with bearish investors borrowing and selling shares, betting on price declines. That can lead to a so-called short squeeze when a lot of bears rush to buy stock to close their negative bets all at once. That’s one potential reason. There have also been some product-distribution announcements at Beyond and its rivals in recent days. Still, it’s hard to pin the $40 stock price jump over the past month on any single data point. Apple (AAPL) stock is moving, a little. Shares of the tech giant were downgraded at Atlantic Equities to the equivalent of Sell from Hold. Some analysts are wondering if the stock can continue its epic run. Apple shares are up 111% over the past year. Boeing (BA) and Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) are unchanged in premarket trading, but both stocks could move more than usual Tuesday. The bond-rating company Moody’s put Boeing debt on watch for a credit downgrade. Moody’s downgraded debt of Spirit, a key Boeing supplier, into junk-bond territory. Banks kick off earnings season Tuesday. Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report numbers. JPMorgan earned more than expected for the fourth quarter.

Ready or not, here comes earnings season. Investors seem to be on the fence as JPMorgan Chase kicks things off with its fourth-quarter results, with Wells Fargo and Citigroup to come.On the heels of Monday’s record session for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite  , stock futures are just about flat. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are also steady. Futures came under pressure in early European trading hours, but have pulled back from those losses.Investors have been optimistic ahead of the signing of a “phase one” trade deal this week, and after the U.S. said China is no longer a “currency manipulator.” Earnings were in the spotlight as JPMorgan’s profit and revenue beat expectations, and shares are up in premarket trading. “The bar has been successfully and reliably lowered heading into the season and expectations are for a fourth consecutive quarter of negative earnings growth,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange company OANDA Europe, in a note to clients.Our call of the day, from Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth manager Janney Montgomery Scott, says a lot needs to fall into place for equities this year. And one thing investors don’t want is an overexcited stampede into this market.“If again we experience a FOMO (fear-of-missing-out) environment in which the [S&P] market rockets up to 3,500 and we’re at 20 times forward earnings and that global recovery story doesn’t develop and the dollar strengthens as a consequence of it,” then that will hurt the earnings picture and leave stocks vulnerable, he told MarketWatch in an interview.

Economists have been warning for years that the U.S. economy could start to look like Japan’s, using the term “Japanification” to describe that change. But Bernstein Research is questioning the comparison. From a distance, there are obvious similarities between the U.S. and Japan. Both countries implemented ultra-loose monetary policies after debt-fueled financial crises. And, despite their central banks’ best efforts, both have experienced relatively sluggish and inconsistent economic growth. Because the Japanese financial crisis happened in the 1980s, some Wall Street strategists think America’s future could look a lot like Japan’s recent past. But in a note on Monday, Bernstein economists cautioned against trying to draw neat parallels between the two countries. One key difference is inflation, according to economists Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak and Paul Swartz. U.S. consumer prices haven’t been stagnant, unlike in Japan, where prices experienced a few years of deflation in the decade after the financial crisis. U.S. policy makers see inflation as 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points too low, whereas Japanese leaders think inflation is 2 percentage points too low, the economists wrote.That is why the U.S. has been able to keep its interest rates above zero for years, in their view, while Japan hasn’t. “Largely speaking, full-blown Japanification is not the right lens for the U.S. outlook—even if the U.S. has a mild case of the disease,” Carlsson-Szlezak and Swartz wrote.The inflation divergence hints at a few differences between the two economies. First, investment in the U.S. has been steadier than in Japan, where investment collapsed after its financial crisis. Second, the U.S. population has been growing, albeit at a slowing pace, while Japan’s hasn’t. Third, productivity growth—the economic output per unit of labor (or other input)—has been higher in the U.S. than in Japan, although it has slowed in both countries. The economists, however, don’t think the U.S. central bank will be much more effective in the future than Japan’s has been. The Bank of Japan’s policy rate has hovered around zero for more than 20 years. The Federal Reserve cut its policy rates close to zero in 2008 and kept them there for seven years. The Fed has since raised rates, but was able to keep them above 2% for only 16 months. (While Europe has kept interest rates low, as well, that region is grappling with its own set of challenges.) “If Japanification is the unhappy co-existence of heavy stimulus and mediocre growth outcomes, then our coverage of the U.S. economy has frequently pointed out just that pattern,” they wrote. “The fact is that [monetary] policy effectiveness is diminished in the U.S.”So investors may still want to consider the implications for U.S. stocks, they said. Japan has been hit by more recessions than the U.S. has, and the Bernstein economists attribute that partly to the ineffectiveness of Bank of Japan policy. And in the 35 years since Japan’s financial crisis, the Japanese stock market has experienced more large declines than have U.S. stocks.“While not the full explanation, we find it easy to believe that part of the reason for this is that a regime with less policy leeway and more recessions is worse for equity investors,” they wrote. That might not bode well for the next 25 years of U.S. stock market returns—yet the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are both still close to their latest record highs.

Three numbers to start your day:—from the year before. That might seem like a big decline, but it probably isn’t as bad as it sounds.First of all, companies have bought back a lot of stock over the past year. That means each remaining share is entitled to a larger portion of the company’s income. And that means the S&P 500 companies’ earnings per share could actually have fallen only 0.4% last quarter.Another thing is that companies tend to beat analysts’ estimates for their earnings. If they did so at their historical rate last quarter, S&P 500 earnings per share could end up 0.5% higher than a year ago. That’s according to Credit Suisse. That’s better than a 2.6% drop—but still nothing to write home about.It’s behind the broader market, but better than most of Delta’s competitors.That’s because airline sales and earnings are highly sensitive to the health of the broader economy—which means they can see big swings. And that uncertainty has kept a lid on airline stocks’ valuations. Delta and its peers trade for a big discount to the rest of the market.Delta (DAL) will have a chance to update investors on its recent performance when it reports fourth-quarter earnings this morning.—at the end of its most recent quarter. And investors are getting more and more worried that the Canadian pot producer will have difficulty paying back its creditors—especially because it’s going to be a while before the company is profitable.And so investors have piled out of the stock. Aurora Cannabis (ACB) shares have dropped almost 22% since the start of 2020 alone.

Shares of alternative-asset managers went on a terrific run in 2019, but it may be time for investors to take profits and move to the sidelines. Citing valuation as a concern, JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan downgraded shares of two alt-managers on Monday: Apollo Global Management (APO) and KKR (KKR). He assigned Neutral ratings to the stocks, down from Outperform, though he left his 2020 earnings estimates intact. He also maintained a Neutral rating on Blackstone Group (BX).“We remain constructive on these businesses longer term,” Ryan wrote, “but after an impressive run in 2019, we are moving to the sidelines for now and will be looking for a more attractive re-entry point.”Listed private-equity firms surged in 2019, fueled in part by a change in their corporate structure and share issuance. The firms converted from limited partnerships to standard C corporations, and they converted their “units” (the equivalent of shares) to dividend-paying stock. KKR converted to a C corporation in 2018; Apollo and Blackstone converted in 2019. The conversions opened the stocks to more indexes and a wider array of mutual funds—many of which wouldn’t own partnership units or had restrictions on what they could own. The stocks benefited mightily: Apollo soared 94%, Blackstone rose 88%, and KKR gained 49%. But earnings for the companies haven’t improved nearly as much, leaving valuations stretched. Ryan estimates that price/earnings multiples for Apollo, KKR, and Blackstone expanded 45% in the past year. The stocks now trade at an average of 17 times “distributable earnings,” well above the 13.5 times P/E ratio for retail brokers and 11 times P/E for advisory firms. Fundamentals remain strong for private-equity companies, including robust fundraising for their underlying funds and assets, and strong investment performance, Ryan notes. Capital is flooding into private-equity firms, raising the potential for increases in fee-related income. With interest rates staying low, private-equity firms should be able to access cheap capital and deploy it at higher yields. And the companies appear to be getting a bit more shareholder friendly. They have switched to earnings metrics that look closer to generally accepted accounting principles, highlighting “distributable earnings” rather than “economic net income,” a non-GAAP measure of earnings that they previously reported as a bottom-line measure. Switching to distributable earnings should create more comfort with investors, according to Ryan. And it is a step up from the firms’ prior focus on economic net income, which often resulted in investors being taken by surprise when the firms reported negative results. But these positives may now be more than reflected in valuations. Ryan, for instance, increased his 2020 estimate for “performance-related earnings” by 50% for the group. “Any shortfall on this front could be disappointing to the market, particularly given current valuations,” he wrote.One other casualty of the conversions and stock appreciation is that dividend yields aren’t looking nearly as appealing. Apollo yields 4% at its current, annualized payout rate. Blackstone pays 3.3%, and KKR yields 1.7%. Those yields are well below historical averages. Apollo’s 5-year average yield was 7.9%, Blackstone was 6.8% and KKR’s was 5.4%. Buying the stocks now means that investors would be banking on more price gains or big increases in their dividends—both of which may be tall hurdles to surmount.

 On the Go. The three main U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Monday as investors looked ahead to the signing of the preliminary U.S.-China trade deal on Wednesday. Corporate earnings for the fourth quarter will also start to roll in this week, led by major banks. U.S.-Iran tension remains in the air after Tehran said over the weekend that it shot down a Boeing 737 aircraft unintentionally due to “human error”. In today’s After the Bell, we… Earnings Week Started All three major indexes closed in the black on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 83.28 points, or 0.29%, to close at 28,907.05, The S&P 500 added 22.78 points, or 0.70%, to end at 3288.13, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 95.07 points, or 1.04%, to close at 9273.93.The U.S. and China are set to sign a much-anticipated “phase one” trade deal on Wednesday. Besides the reduction of some existing tariffs and China’s commitment to buy more American farm products, full details of the 86-page deal haven’t been publicly disclosed. The Wall Street Journal reported that the two countries have agreed to semiannual talks to push for economic reform and resolve disputes.The U.S. Treasury Department will also drop its designation of China as a “currency manipulator,” which was imposed on the country last August.The stock market has risen on optimism that the trade deal could lift corporate confidence and capital expenditures in both the U.S. and China. The tone set at the signing event might matter more than the details of the deal itself.As the U.S. election nears, most policy watchers don’t expect the Trump administration to re-escalate tension with China. Still, if President Donald Trump strikes a negative tone and emphasizes his skepticism about whether China will live up to its commitment, the market might continue to feel pressure on the trade front even after the deal is signed.Looking beyond trade, investors are also focused on fourth-quarter earnings season, which kicks off this week with 26 S&P 500 components expected to release results. Banks, as usual, are among the first reporters, including JPMorgan Chase (ticker: JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs Group (GS).Corporate earnings haven’t been keeping pace with the rise of stock prices in recent months. While the S&P 500 kept hitting record highs, Wall Street expects earnings per share in 2019’s fourth quarter to slip 2% from a year ago, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines, according to FactSet. 73 S&P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance, only 34 issued positive guidance. With the de-escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions and a dovish Federal Reserve, investors may be focusing more on corporate outlooks for fiscal 2020. Wall Street expects S&P 500 companies to see EPS grow again this year by an estimated 4.7%.Still, stock valuations are at a relatively lofty level after 2019’s rally, meaning investors are paying more for each dollar of earnings. The S&P 500 companies are now trading at 18.4 times forward earnings, according to FactSet, as compared with the 15.5 times a year ago, and the five-year average of 16.7 times. The multiples are now at a similar level as early 2018, right before the market tumbled into a correction.

Unseasonably warm winter weather across the Northeast and Midwest recently may be great for those who hate the cold. It isn’t good for a company that sells windshield wipers and antifreeze.The weather is a big factor behind a Monday downgrade for Advance Auto Parts by J.P. Morgan that left shares of the Raleigh, N.C.-based company 2.5% lower on a day when other stocks were rising. Christopher Horvers and a team of analysts cut the stock to Neutral from Outperform and removed it from the bank’s Analyst Focus List. “The key drivers of demand/sales for auto parts include: GDP growth, miles driven, inflation, car park dynamics, and (of course) weather,” said Horvers. Outside of the weather, the analysts highlighted moderating growth forecasts and less inflation, as well as a do-it-yourself business they said is “already on shaky ground.” The bank slashed its 2020 forecast for growth in same-store sales to 1.3% from 2.1% and lowered its call for adjusted earnings per share to $8.95 from $9.33. J.P. Morgan slightly reduced lowered its end-of-year price target for the stock to $163, which still implies some upside from the level of $144.91 seen Monday.While weather forecasts can change, J.P. Morgan sees a near-term impact for the company into the first quarter from a mild winter, as well as a longer-term one. Harsh winters mean batteries, for example, need to be replaced sooner, while equipment tends to last longer in milder weather. The Midwest and Northeast, where the weather is typically colder, account for 45% of its stores, while AutoZone and O’Reilly Automotive have just 36% and 26% exposure, respectively. Advance Auto has just 7% exposure to the West while its peers have exposure in the 20% bracket. J.P. Morgan notes that for those expecting a change to higher margins for Advance Auto, it needs a better sales performance to get there. And there is more risk of sales falling than opportunities for growth, says Horvers. Some 54% of analysts that cover the stock remain positive, according to FactSet. Some may be hanging in there, reasoning that things can’t get worse. But investors who jump into the beaten-down stock at this point may be taking on Mother Nature. That doesn’t usually work out.

 Despite soft holiday sales data from retailers like Kohl’s (ticker: KSS) and J.C. Penney (JCP) last week, yoga pants maker Lululemon Athletica continued to see strong momentum and raised its outlook for the current quarter ending in February. The back story. Lululemon stock (LULU) soared more than 90% last year, as investors have high hopes for the Canadian apparel maker’s growth story. Known for its $100 yoga pants, Lululemon has made efforts to broaden its product range to menswear and self-care products, expand to international markets, improve the in-store shopping experience, and develop a subscription-based loyalty program. Driven by the initiatives, sales have increased more than 20% each quarter in fiscal 2018 and 2019.Lululemon’s growth appears even more rare as the retail sector as a whole struggles to meet consumer’s shifting needs. The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund (XRT) increased only 12.2% in 2019, less than half of the S&P 500’s 28.8% gain. What’s new. On Monday, Lululemon raised its quarterly revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal 2019’s fourth quarter ending Feb. 2. The stock jumped almost 4% on Monday to reach an all-time intraday high of $244.30.The yoga apparel maker now forecasts earnings between $2.22 and $2.25 a share on revenue of $1.37 billion to $1.38 billion for the fourth quarter, compared with previous guidance of $2.10 to $2.13 a share on revenue of $1.31 billion to $1.33 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected $2.15 a share on sales of $1.35 billion. Compared with the year-ago period, the sales increase outlook now sits “in the mid to high teens,” up from the previous guidance for growth “in the low double digits.”The raised outlook indicates that Lululemon has had a successful holiday season and attracted new customers. “We’re excited by the momentum in our business over the holiday period with guests responding well to our innovative merchandise offerings,” said CEO Calvin McDonald in a statement. Looking ahead. While investors are optimistic about Lululemon’s future growth, last year’s rally has left the stock with fairly high valuation. Shares are trading at nearly 43 times forward earnings, according to FactSet, much higher than its five-year average of 30 times and the 21 times of peers in the S&P 500’s consumer discretionary sector. Lululemon will need to keep surprising the market to justify its lofty valuation. About 60% of analysts polled by FactSet rated the stock as Buy or equivalent, the average target price for the stock is at $247, just slightly above the current level.

Fourth-quarter earnings season is here, with 26 S&P 500 components releasing results this week and the majority of the index reporting over the coming month. Banks, as usual, are among the first reporters, including JPMorgan Chase (ticker: JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), and Goldman Sachs Group (GS).U.S. stocks have enjoyed a sharp rise in recent months, but analysts don’t see corporate earnings keeping pace. In fact, the consensus forecast has net income for the aggregate S&P 500 falling 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019 from a year earlier. That would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year net income declines.But there’s more to that headline number. First of all, stock buybacks continue to reduce companies’ share counts, boosting earnings on a per-share basis. Earnings per share, therefore, are seen falling just 0.4% in the latest quarter. And since companies tend to exceed earnings estimates, the fourth quarter could end up with a 0.5% year-over-year growth in EPS, according to Credit Suisse’s chief U.S. equity strategist, Jonathan Golub.Still, it puts the S&P 500 on track for just 0.6% EPS growth in all of 2019, a far cry from 2018’s tax-cut juiced 23% increase. The market’s recent exuberance has little to do with 2019’s tepid earnings-per-share growth and more to do with improving sentiment. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings multiple has climbed to nearly 19, versus its 10-year average of about 15. That means investors are paying more for each dollar of earnings.The U.S. and China are set to sign a “phase one” trade deal in Washington this week, potentially helping to ease a major damper on corporate confidence. If companies feel more comfortable making long-term investment decisions and increasing their capital expenditures in 2020, that could portend an improvement in earnings—at least so the thinking goes.And that could justify 2019’s rise and keep stocks climbing in 2020. Analysts expect S&P 500 companies’ net income to return to growth this year, with earnings-per-share up 4.7%.Each year is different, of course, but the market has shown it’s able to put lackluster earnings in the rearview mirror quickly. Here’s a look at how the S&P 500 has performed in years following annual earnings declines.

 Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley report earnings tomorrow and JMP Securities expects Goldman to shine, while Morgan Stanley will reap more incremental gains. JMP’s Devin Ryan upgraded Goldman Sachs from Market Perform to Market Outperform and downgraded Morgan Stanley from Market Outperform to Market Perform, in a Monday note to clients.Goldman Sachs stock (ticker: GS) was up 1.4% to $245.49 near midday Monday, while Morgan Stanley stock (MS) was up 0.9% to $52.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2%. “Goldman Sachs is in the early stages of one of the most meaningful transformations within financial services,” Ryan wrote. While “Morgan Stanley’s transformation over the past decade has been impressive,” he said, he expects the bank’s growth will now be “respectable (mid-single digits organically)” rather than “substantially [moving] the needle.”One positive for Goldman Sachs is more openness, Ryan said. “We think 2020 will be a pivotal year of transparency.” The bank has revamped its business segments in an effort to increase the transparency of its financial reporting and is scheduled to host its first-ever investor day later this month. As part of the organizational changes, the bank will for now break out results for a newly constituted “Consumer & Wealth Management” unit. Goldman has recently pushed into consumer banking, a departure from its historical focus solely on institutional, corporate and very wealthy customers.Goldman’s newer initiatives “will provide another leg of revenue and earnings growth that have not been present over the past decade,” Ryan wrote. He thinks that growth will boost its price-to-earnings multiple from the high single digits to around 12.

The combination of low interest rates, rangebound oil prices and continued economic expansion creates a solid backdrop for U.S. equities. But with the market at record highs, Goldman Sachs is thinking about what could unsettle stocks and limit the upside the investment bank sees for stocks in 2020. They’re telling clients to consider four macro risks to its 2020 outlook—a long conflict with Iran, higher interest rates, a stronger dollar, and weak economic growth—and tossed in a fifth non-macro risk to boot. Oil-price shocks should have limited impact on S&P 500 returns, Goldman analysts say, given offsetting impacts from higher energy-sector earnings and higher gasoline prices for consumers. A prolonged conflict, however, could eventually weigh on U.S. stocks. Energy was the worst-performing sector in 2019, lagging the S&P 500 by about 20 percentage points. Although stocks in the sector have diverged from spot oil prices, they trade roughly in line with 10-year oil prices, Goldman says, adding that’s the reason the energy-sector rally alongside the recent US-Iran tensions—which lifted spot prices but not long-dated prices—was short-lived. Without a sustained supply shock that impacts long-term oil prices, Goldman says it maintains its Underweight recommendation in energy stocks. In contrast, aerospace, defense and cybersecurity firms with business models more clearly linked to geopolitical conflicts have each rallied by about 2%.Low bond yields drove more than 90% of the S&P 500’s return last year, Goldman says. While valuations are elevated in absolute terms, Goldman’s macro model suggests that equities are trading at roughly fair value relative to bond yields. The bank’s economists expect the Fed will remain on hold in 2020 and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will gradually rise to 2.25% by year-end (from its current 1.85%).For equities, the analysts say the speed of rate changes matters more than the level of rates and that historically, equities have been able to digest gradual increases in bond yields of less than 1 standard deviation in a month (which translates to 16 basis points in today’s terms). But when bond yields rise by more than 2 standard deviations in a month (or 34 basis points), S&P 500 returns have typically been negative.The dollar fell by 2% in December as U.S.-China trade tensions eased and global economies showed signs of improvement. Goldman’s foreign exchange strategists expect the trade-weighted dollar to fall by 2% during the next 12 months. A stronger dollar would pose a headwind to S&P 500 sales, particularly within industries with high non-US sales such as semiconductors. Goldman says that based on its top-down earnings model, it estimates that every 10% change in the trade-weighted dollar equals roughly $3 of S&P 500 earnings per share. International-facing stocks have outperformed domestic-facing stocks by 4 percentage points during the past month alongside the falling dollar. At the sector-level, Energy and Materials have demonstrated the strongest negative correlation with the U.S. dollar, while Staples and Health Care have the strongest positive correlation, the analysts say.U.S. economic data have been mixed. Take the Institute for Supply Management’s nonmanufacturing index, which showed expansion in the service sector and most recently came in above expectations. Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing index unexpectedly declined to the lowest level since 2009. Goldman’s economists expect U.S. real gross domestic product growth of 2.2% this year, above the consensus expectation of 1.9%, as easing in financial conditions lifts economic activity. Looking forward, Goldman says it believes economic and earnings growth will drive stock prices higher. Every 1 percentage point change in U.S. real GDP growth equals $5 in S&P 500 EPS, they add. Goldman says it sees scope for upside to cyclical stocks in the near term if growth reaccelerates toward its forecast and recommends an Overweight position in Industrials. A final point Goldman makes: investor positioning in U.S. equities is close to “stretched territory,” potentially exacerbating equity price moves if one of the above four risks materializes. They arrive at this conclusion based on their sentiment indicator that combines six weekly and three monthly indicators of stock positioning across institutional, retail and foreign investors. As equities rallied during the final weeks of 2019, Goldman’s indicator rose to 1.8 standard deviations above the 52-week average. Readings in “stretched” territory above +1.0 standard deviations have typically corresponded with below-average equity returns during the subsequent eight weeks, they say, adding that in the most recent week the gauge fell slightly to 0.9 standard deviations.

In one of the few notable acquisitions to emerge as the annual J.P. Morgan health care conference gets under way, the telemedicine firm Teladoc Health announced plans to acquire InTouch Health, which sells telehealth software and services to hospitals, for $600 million in cash and stock.The news triggered a 9.3% spike in shares of Teladoc (TDOC), which has soared in recent months. Teladoc is up about 63% over the last 12 months.Analysts praised the deal, which broadens Teladoc’s offerings. The company has largely focused on offering services to health insurers, whereas InTouch Health sells telemedicine tools.“We view the acquisition positively from a strategic perspective, as it expands TDOC’s offerings across care settings and enhances its platform,” wrote Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper in a note out Sunday. The back story. Teladoc is an early leader in the nascent field of telemedicine. The company is expected to benefit as the federal government allows Medicare Advantage plans to offer more telehealth services in 2020. What’s new. The deal, announced Sunday, pushes Teladoc into competition to provide hospitals and other health-care providers with telemedicine tools. The company has previously focused on selling health insurers telemedicine services for their clients to use.Teladoc is set to pay $150 million in cash and $450 million in Teladoc shares to buy InTouch Health, a privately held company. InTouch Health works with 450 hospitals and health systems world wide, according to Teladoc’s release. “TDOC has very successfully focused on the payer market in recent years,” wrote Jefferies analyst David Windley in a note out Monday. “This acquisition positions TDOC well in the provider market, too.”Teladoc expects the deal to close by the end of the second quarter of the year.“In addition to the expanded opportunity, we believe the acquisition should improve TDOC’s relationships with hospitals and health systems,” wrote Cantor Fitzgerald’s Halper. That could help Teladoc win the business of health systems that want to “white-label” their virtual care offerings, Halper wrote. Looking ahead. Teladoc is scheduled to make its presentation at J.P. Morgan’s conference in San Francisco at 12 p.m. Eastern time. Halper wrote that the company is likely to give more details on the deal during the presentation.

 Aurora Cannabis stock has lost more than a quarter of its value from the start of the year. An analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald thinks the recent pullback makes it a good time to buy the shares. The back story. Aurora Cannabis (ticker: ACB) stock has fallen nearly 76% in the past year, and 27% so far in 2020. Two analysts lowered their neutral ratings and price targets to $1 last week, noting concerns about the firm’s ability to generate cash to pay off debt. Aurora was down 4.2% to $1.58 on Monday morning while the S&P 500 index was up 0.4%. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchanged-traded fund (MJ), viewed as a de facto proxy for the pot industry, was up 2.5%.One of the company’s greenhouses appeared in an online sale listing, though the company clarified it was nonoperational and came with its acquisition of MedReleaf. The company said last month Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley, one of the more public-facing executives in speaking with media and investors, was leaving the company. Cantor Fitzergald analyst Pablo Zuanic wrote in a note earlier this month that strategic advisor Nelson Peltz should help the company find a chief executive officer who will bring greater financial discipline. What's new. Zuanic wrote on Monday that the recent stock decline is a reaction to analyst downgrades and “misperceived matters.”“The CCO departure was good news, in our view; a planned asset sale is being done pretty much at book value; and debt covenants imply positive EBITDA by mid-year,” he wrote. He also argues trends have not worsened, noting conversations with management where they reaffirmed their prior outlook for the December quarter. They’re also confident sales will ramp up in the second half of the fiscal year, with help from newly introduced cannabis derivative products like edibles and vapes.“We would make use of the recent pullback (ACB -30% 30d vs. -10% for the group),” he wrote, referring to Canadian cannabis peers. “The poor liquidity makes the stock sensitive to downgrades (some done despite the absence of new catalysts/news) and misplaced market chatter.” Looking Ahead. Zuanic expects positive Ebitda by the June quarter, and operating expenses as a percentage of sales to start coming down.His fiscal 2020 sales estimate of 338 million Canadian dollars (US$259 million) is well below consensus estimates at C$395 million, and is 32% lower than consensus for fiscal 2021.

Ahead of its appearance at this week’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, GW Pharmaceuticals, the only company with an approved drug derived from cannabis, says that 2019 sales came in better than expected.The British drug company said on Sunday that its seizure treatment Epidiolex achieved sales of $104 million in the December quarter and $296 million in 2019—its first year of sales.Its stock (ticker: GWPH) rose 5% on the news, to $113.31. Its preannounced sales for the fourth quarter were somewhat better than predicted by admirers like Guggenheim’s Yatin Suneja, and the analyst wrote on Monday that he came away reassured about his Buy rating after talking to GW’s management. A rush of Buy recommendations followed the launch of Epidiolex after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it as a treatment for difficult forms of epilepsy. The drug started strong, and GW stock soared to $196 a share, before sinking amid the cannabis sector selloff in last year’s second half.Yet there is little in sight that is likely to return GW stock to its stratospheric peak. Guggenheim’s Suneja happily noted that the seizure drug’s $296 million in 2019 sales were nearly three times as high as Wall Street forecast at the drug’s introduction. But sales are decelerating. Sales grew 18% sequentially in the December quarter, after a 27% sequential jump in September. Side effects have caused patients to discontinue the drug. And March quarters bring seasonal headwinds for drug companies—the Guggenheim analyst wrote—as payers notch up their discounts in the new year. Suneja expressed relief after GW management told him that they expected modest sales growth in March, rather than a down quarter.Suneja hopes that GW will get FDA approval to market Epidiolex for an additional seizure disorder around midyear. The company also plans to start clinical trials this year for another cannabis-based drug as a treatment for multiple sclerosis and post-traumatic stress disorder.Even at Monday’s $113 price, GW is no cheap stock. Unlike other cannabis companies, Epidiolex’s developer took the expensive route of running scientific studies for its product. Analysts don’t expect the company to report its first profit until later this year and the consensus forecast on FactSet for 2020 is for earnings of just 8 cents a share.GW was well-rewarded for its seizure drug’s strong launch. Now, the momentum is slowing for Epidiolex and Suneja says he expects the company to stop giving out details like the number of new patients starting on the drug—when GW reports its full December results on Feb. 25. That is not a sign of strength. Write to Bill Alpert at william.alpert@barrons.com~markets~GW Pharmaceuticals~2020-01-13~The launch of Epidiolex prompted a bevy of Buy recommendations.

After a bumpy start, tobacco stocks climbed toward the end of 2019, and gains seem to be continuing into this year. But investors may want to think twice before chasing that move higher.So say Callum Elliott and Ajay Soni, analysts at asset manager AB Bernstein, who told clients in a note on Monday why they think that reprieve may be short-lived in 2020.The rally, which sent shares of Swedish Match and British American Tobacco up around 30% in just three months, can be partly attributed to a stabilization in U.S.-cigarette volume declines, they say.But Elliott and Soni see potential headwinds this year from a new U.S. federal law that will raise the minimum age for buying tobacco to 21, and the rollout of Altria’s IQOS heated tobacco device. In the longer term, they say there may be a greater impact on volumes as consumers come to better understand the health implications of vaping versus smoking. Read: One Analyst Says It’s Time to Buy Altria Another reason for those recent gains — signs of pricing power by U.S. companies — may end up just driving more users away in the longer term, they warn. Finally, the AB Bernstein analysts are concerned that in a big U.S. election year, “the outlook for new regulatory developments is more likely than not to skew toward the negative.” Looking Ahead. Across the sector, they see the most potential for Swedish Match, even though shares are up 11% this year already. They note the Stockholm-based company trades at a “substantial discount” to other sizable European consumer stocks and none of its rivals are expected to grow as fast. Rated outperform, they believe shares can climb another 14% from here. The company claims to be No. 2 in the U.S. for mass-market cigars and the biggest manufacturer of chewing tobacco. As for market-perform rated Altria, which lagged behind last year with a small gain partly due to an aborted merger attempt with Philip Morris International, they see about 12% upside from current levels for shares. Potential positive catalysts include significant growth of IQOS and improving trends on cigarette volumes.As the analysts point out, 2019 was a roller-coaster ride that was only saved by the last quarter. In terms of regulation a U.S. crackdown on nicotine in cigarettes was not as severe as feared. But this is still an industry that is battling to keep volumes. Though beaten-down companies may have more gains in store for 2020, investors who feel they escaped a tough 2019 with some decent returns might be served by sitting out what could be another tumultuous year.~markets~British American Tobacco~2020-01-13~Tobacco stocks had a roller coaster 2019 that ended on a high note.

It is earnings season again, the time when investors and analysts get to hear about businesses and the economy directly from corporate-management teams. Delta Air Lines (ticker: DAL), an early reporter, will release fourth-quarter numbers before the market opens on Tuesday. Investors will be on the lookout for clues about the health of the U.S. consumer, business-travel spending and management’s thoughts about volatile energy prices. Here is what to expect, along with some recent history: Delta Air Lines shares have been the best performing among airline stocks over the past year. Shares are up about 22%, compared with the 14% loss in American Airlines (AAL) stock, the 11% gain in Southwest Airlines (LUV) shares and the 9% gain in United Airlines Holdings (UAL) shares. Airline shares overall, however, have lagged behind comparable gains for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Parsing CEO pay can be a chore. It’s broken down by base salary, target bonuses, target long-term incentive awards, pensions, separate milestones, and signing bonuses. It’s Byzantine. It’s enough to say American CEOs are well compensated. Boeing (ticker: BA) released some new compensation details for incoming CEO Dave Calhoun on Friday afternoon. He stands to make millions if he can get the troubled MAX jet—grounded since mid-March 2019 following two deadly crashes within a five-month span—back into service. Calhoun is taking over for former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who resigned at the end of December. According to the filing, Calhoun gets a base salary of $1.4 million to start. Total annual compensation, including bonuses and long-term incentive awards will come to about $11 million a year. There is an additional $7 million payment tied solely to 737 MAX milestones. (Details of the MAX milestones weren’t included.) Calhoun will also receive a $10 million payment—like a signing bonus in connection with foregone compensation at other employers—for taking the top job.“The Board is confident Dave is the right leader to strengthen Boeing’s safety culture, improve transparency and rebuild trust,” a Boeing spokesperson told Barron’s in an emailed statement. “Long term incentives will be tied to business outcomes enabled by improved safety and the Board is also adding enhanced claw-back provisions that will sharpen our focus on safety and apply to situations of misconduct that compromise safety.”The annual compensation for the former General Electric (GE) aviation executive is a little lower than former CEO Muilenburg had earned as Boeing CEO. Proxy statements—annual filings that cover, among other things, executive compensation—show Muilenburg averaged more than $15 million a year in total compensation over his four-plus year tenure as CEO. But compensation tends to increase from year to year. Muilenburg’s long term incentive compensation award, for instance, was targeted at about 750% of his base pay in 2019, up from 700% in 2018. Calhoun’s long term incentive compensation award starts out at 500% of base pay. Muilenburg did leave some money on the table when he retired. He forfeited some incentive compensation on exit, about $15 million in pay. It wasn’t fully vested—executive incentive payouts are earned bit by bit over time. Overall, Muilenburg left with about $30 million in incentive awards and a pension worth about $30 million. He also hold stock options and other compensation valued at about $22 million. He will, very roughly, collect more than $80 million from Boeing in retirement. Calhoun, for his part, has a big job ahead of him. He has to restore trust of several aviation stakeholders while getting the MAX back into commercial service. Regarding pay, Boeing’s shareholders have the chance to vote on coming pay packages, recommended by the board, in coming years to demonstrate how they feel about the direction of the commercial aerospace giant under new leadership. Boeing shares are down about 22% since the mid-March, after the second MAX crash involving an Ethiopian Airlines flight, trailing far behind comparable gains of the S&P 500 as well as aerospace peers such as Airbus (AIR.France). The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 13%, excluding dividends, over the same span. Boeing stock has gained 0.4% to $331.09 in early Monday trading.

The imminent signing of a “phase one” trade deal between the U.S. and China after months of negotiations and tensions looks set to boost stocks further. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly broke the 29,000 milestone on Friday before dropping back, with the index set to rise again on Monday.Dow futures are up 0.3%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also climbed ahead of the open. European stocks fell back after earlier gains, and Asian markets were mixed overnight.After a blockbuster 2019 it has been a volatile start to the year, but a trade truce, expected to be signed later this week, should improve sentiment. Goldman Sachs ’ chief global equity strategist, Peter Oppenheimer, said the strong gains of 2019 were driven by valuation expansion, which history shows will lead to more gains this year.Oppenheimer said: “Years of strong valuation expansion are generally followed by positive returns in the equity market, although typically at a slower pace. Moderate profit growth this year and higher starting multiples point to total returns in the high single digits for the asset class globally in 2020.”He added that there was a “compelling case” for equities to outperform other asset classes in 2020, far ahead of government bonds, cash and credit.The investment bank expects the economic cycle to continue to expand, with profits likely to grow and equities making progress through the year.U.S. stocks have outperformed those in Europe and Asia over the past decade, and while Goldman said it did not believe there were compelling reasons for that reversing in 2020, it said the gap would start to narrow.“With investors likely to become increasingly focused on U.S. election risk, and less on risks in Europe and Asia, we think there is a good argument for more geographic diversification,” Oppenheimer said.~markets~NASDAQ Composite Index~2020-01-13~The imminent signing of a “phase one” trade deal between the U.S. and China after months of negotiations and tensions looks set to boost stocks further.~NASDAQ Composite Index,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,equity markets,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,routine market,financial news,europe,markets now,us~U.S. Stocks to Open Higher as ‘Phase One’ Trade Deal Nears~https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-stocks-to-open-higher-as-phase-one-trade-deal-nears-51578921049?mod=hp_LEAD_1~2020

European earnings results will begin next week. In addition, the U.S. and China are due to sign a preliminary trade pact.U.S. stock futures were stronger, pointing to opening gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The British pound fell below $1.30 after a Bank of England policymaker said he was willing to vote for looser monetary policy if the U.K. economy doesn’t pick up. Data released on Monday showed the U.K. economy contracted during November.Of stocks in the spotlight, Renault shares fell 3.7% as the Financial Times reported that Nissan senior managers have sped up discussions over a potential split from the French automaker. The Japanese carmaker holds 15% of Renault, while Renault owns 43% of Nissan.Carlos Ghosn, the fugitive former chief executive of both Nissan and Renault, has been critical of the Japanese company’s strategy.

The stock market rally continues. U.S. stocks are headed for a higher open, following global equity markets in Monday morning trading. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index is up 1.1%. Europe’s FTSE 100 Index is up 0.4%. In the U.S., Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 futures have advanced 0.4%. Nasdaq Composite futures have risen 0.5%. No new bad news over the weekend in the Middle East is part of the reason for the good feelings. But that fact also has oil prices—and some oil stocks—lower in premarket trading. International crude prices are down 0.5%. Oil field services and equipment supplier Schlumberger (ticker: SLB) stock is off 4.3%. Spotify (SPOT) shares are also down in premarket trading, by about 1.3%. Evercore ISI analyst Benjamin Black downgraded the stock from the equivalent of Hold to Sell. He has a $115 target price for the stock, down more than 25% from recent levels. Yet as you’d expect in a strong market, it isn’t taking much to get some stocks trending higher. Beyond Meat (ticker: BYND) shares, for instance, cracked $100 again in premarket trading, up about 4.8%. The stock is up because it’s volatile. There isn’t much news to pin the gains on. McDonald’s (MCD) said recently it is expanding it’s plant based burger—made with a Beyond Meat patty—in Canada. And Beyond shares started rallying last week after rival Impossible Foods unveiled Impossible Pork at the Consumer Electronics show. Beyond stock has ranged from $25 to more than $230 over the past year. Boeing (BA) shares are also up 1% in premarket trading. Like Beyond shares there isn’t a lot of news to pin gains on. Boeing released compensation details for incoming CEO Dave Calhoun on Friday evening. He takes the reins at the embattled aerospace giant this week. Merger news in the aerospace industry also has other stocks moving. Engine parts maker Woodward (WWD) shares are up 0.4%. Advanced materials supplier Hexcel (HXL) shares are up 1.5%.

Forget “merger Monday.” Two aerospace suppliers surprised investors on Sunday, announcing a merger of equals on what is supposed to be a day of rest.Engine-technology maker Woodward (ticker: WWD) and advanced-materials supplier Hexcel (HXL) are combining in a $16 billion deal. The companies are of similar size. Hexcel is worth about $7.2 billion, including debt. Woodward has a market value of about $9 billion. Woodward shareholders will receive 55% of the stock of the new entity. “Both Woodward and Hexcel have attractive growth trajectories, with strong aftermarket positions and increased composite penetration driving our respective outlooks,” Woodward CEO Tom Gendron said in the company’s new release. Woodward makes engine components. Its sales growth is tied to the growth of commercial aerospace. Woodward components end up on Boeing (BA) 777 jets and the Airbus (AIR.France) A350. Woodward also has an industrial business serving transportation and power-generation markets. Hexcel, on the other hand, makes advanced materials such as carbon fiber composites that are used in the manufacture of new planes and wind turbines. “We see significant opportunities to drive greater penetration and innovation in integrated propulsion systems in particular,” Hexcel CEO Nick Stanage said on a merger conference call. “Woodward Hexcel will be a premier systems provider for engines and the cells, which is a critical focus area for our customers and provides a tremendous opportunity for us to deepen our relationships by driving innovation in one of the most important elements of the aircraft with respect to fuel efficiency and emissions reduction.”Deal synergies—which are often things like a reduction in corporate overhead—are expected to be $125 million a year, or about 2.4% of combined sales. That percentage is below some other deals, reflecting that these two companies don’t have a lot of overlap. This deal has more vertical integration, combining different parts of the supply chain, rather than one competitor taking out another in similar areas of the supply chain. Woodward shares are up about 60% over the past year, better than comparable gains of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. Hexcel stock is up about 20% over the past year, lagging the broader market by a few percentage points. Hexcel stock jumped 8.2% to $78.88 Monday morning, while Woodward gained 3.5% to $126.25.

This could be a good year for long-dated Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, if Bank of America Securities’ view is correct.The bank’s strategists wrote in a Jan. 10 note that “real rates,” or inflation-adjusted yields, should decline this year, meaning that U.S. inflation and inflation expectations will rise relative to Treasury yields. They think the trend will be most pronounced for longer-term Treasury yields and inflation; in simpler terms, they are bullish on 30-year TIPS.The call is notable because TIPS were a popular—but unsuccessful—trade in the years after the financial crisis. Back in 2013, for instance, large-name fund managers lost money on bets that inflation would rise. So why would those bets work now? Well, part of the reason is that the Federal Reserve has expressed willingness to let consumer prices rise faster than its target pace of 2%, to make up for the slow inflation that has characterized the decadelong U.S. economic expansion. And as Barron’swrote late last year, the central bank has considered re-evaluating the way it measures inflation as part of a formal review of its strategies.“At this point the bar to hike is high, and we expect some upside to … inflation expectations,” the bank said. That said, it has become riskier to bet on short-term inflation expectations this year, because oil prices are a key factor in near-term inflation forecasts. And thanks to recent military conflict between the U.S. and Iran, this year has already seen substantial oil-price volatility. Longer-term inflation expectations, on the other hand, “could re-anchor to a higher level” because of the change in the Fed’s approach to policy, they wrote. What’s more, they don’t expect long-term Treasury yields to move substantially this year for a few reasons. First, long-dated Treasuries should see continued demand from global pension investors seeking to match the duration of their liabilities. Second, the Fed has been buying short-term Treasury bills. While it isn’t buying longer-term debt, the purchases should still be enough to offset an expected increase in the supply of longer-term Treasuries this year, and prevent long-term yields from rising too far, the bank says.Third, investors don’t expect the Fed to change its interest-rate policy or outlook this year, and that means long-term Treasuries should trade within a steady range, the bank says.“The market has decided the possibility of the Fed gradually raising rates many years down the road is extremely thin,” the strategists write. “Moreover, we do not see a near term catalyst that fundamentally changes this view, not even a US-China trade deal. This supports our view that long term rates should be fairly anchored.”Bank of America is recommending that its institutional investor clients buy 30-year TIPS and bet on losses in 10-year TIPS. But individual investors who want similar exposure with less risk could simply buy 30-year TIPS.

Three numbers to start your day:—that’s compared with the year before. That figure— scheduled to come out tomorrow—excludes food and energy prices, which can be volatile. And the rate of 2.3% matters because it’s higher than the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2%. When inflation rises above its target, the Fed usually at least considers raising interest rates to slow it down. But the Fed isn’t expected to raise rates any time soon. In fact, the central bank is changing its entire approach to inflation. Officials are willing to let inflation run above target for a while, to make up for the time it spent below the target during the slow recovery from the financial crisis. And Wall Street is paying attention. Strategists and investors are starting to take a bullish view of Treasury inflation-protected securities, known as TIPS, bonds with returns tied to inflation. —a record-setting tumble. The theme park operator warned investors that fourth-quarter sales would be worse than they expected—and that its partner in China had run into trouble. That partner is a company called Riverside Investment, and, as it turns out, hasn’t made promised payments. Now, Six Flags (ticker: SIX) doesn’t expect any revenue from its China partnership. And Six Flags’ trouble isn’t only overseas. Here in the U.S., the company sold fewer season passes and memberships than expected during the holiday season. So overall, its new estimate for fourth-quarter sales is almost 10% lower than analysts’ previous forecasts. —on Tuesday. That would be a 7% increase from the same quarter last year, according to FactSet.It’s that time of year again—fourth-quarter earnings season kicks off in earnest this week with the big banks’ quarterly reports.

Biotech veteran Alexis Borisy thinks he can undersell the drug industry.Here’s the idea: Borisy is starting a company to develop drugs that copy the drugs that big pharma and biotech companies are making, and sell them for about a third of what the competitor drugs are going for.These won’t be generic drugs, which specialty drugmakers already sell at a steep discount—but only after the patents on the drugs they copy expire.Instead, Borisy aims to make fast followers—unique medications, protected by their own patents, that copy a drug or class of drugs. Borisy’s will hit the market just a few years after their competitors at a fraction of the price.“We’re going to make great new drugs, and we’re going to build a sustainable business at scale that can make those great new drugs be available for people and health systems at radically lower prices,” he said.The new company is called EQRx, and is being unveiled on the first day of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, a major annual gathering for pharmaceutical industry companies and investors. The start-up has raised $200 million in Series A funding from big-name biotech venture-capital firms, including Alphabet (ticker: GOOG) subsidiary GV, life sciences investment firm Casdin Capital, and Section 32.Others in the industry, including its biggest players, have also worked on so-called fast followers. The strategy brings risks, including legal challenges. “If you’re in the fast follower, you have to have a very sharp team of patent litigators and scientists look at your molecule, and you look at the claims in all existing patents, to make sure that you’re not infringing on a claim that is broad enough to include your molecule,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business, speaking generally about fast followers.Gordon noted that while fast followers don’t require basic research, their developers do need to do enough preclinical research to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration to do human tests.Borisy says EQRx represents a whole new way of thinking about selling pharmaceuticals; one that cuts against the industry’s philosophy of offsetting high drug discovery costs by charging payers as much as the market will bear.“If only one of 10 drugs that you start working on becomes a successful drug, you’re not thinking of a process efficiency and engineering mode, because you’re just desperate to find the one that works,” he said. “If you can charge what the market will bear on it, then those profits cover the inefficiencies.”That dynamic, Borisy said, is behind the high drug prices. For some of the company’s investors, EQRx represents a way for the market to cut drug prices without the sort of government intervention now discussed by both major political parties.“I think we’re all anticipating that if we don’t do something in a market-based fashion, it’s going to be done to us in a regulatory fashion,” said Krishna Yeshwant, a general partner at GV and a board member of EQRx. “To me, to some degree, it’s surprising it hasn’t happened so far, and I’m only hopeful it’s not too late.”Yeshwant said that GV is dedicating significant resources to the effort, and that he is spending a fifth of his time on EQRx. Borisy, who will serve as EQRx’s chairman and CEO, has a track record: He was a founder of Foundation Medicine, which Roche (ticker: RHBBY) fully acquired in 2018 in a transaction that valued the company at $5.3 billion. He was also a co-founder of Blueprint Medicines (BPMC), and a partner at Third Rock Ventures, a venture capital company focused on health care start-ups.Other executives include its president and chief operating officer, Melanie Nallicheri, another Foundation Medicine veteran; and Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who is listed as a co-founder and advisor. The team currently includes a total of 15 people, according to Borisy.Borisy says that he will be able to develop drugs more cheaply than other companies in part because the drugs he’ll be working on will mimic proven therapies. “They’re not starting out by owning a sandbox and saying, let’s see what we can make from this sandbox,” said Mike Pellini, a managing partner at Section 32. “They are looking at compounds and structures that already exist.”Borisy said that the company would aim to get one of its copycat drugs to market five years after the first drug in a particular class, and then have roughly a decade before the class faces generic competition. His ambitions are vast. He said he would be “disappointed” if the company did not have “dozens upon dozens” of drugs on the market in 15 years.The investors appreciate the scale of the endeavor. “The magnitude of the plan itself is most challenging,” Pellini said. “The magnitude, the notion that you want to have 10 drugs in the clinic in 10 years at dramatically lower pricing, is very bold; it’s a disruptive idea.”The company will start with small molecule drugs and biologics, rather than cutting edge modalities like gene therapy.“Technology has now gotten to a place where we can create equally as good or better new drugs, fast following on that first in class or best in class drug,” Borisy said. “We’re using technology and process engineering and business model engineering to do something that is sitting there obvious to be done, but is radically different than what people have been doing in the industry.” Write to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com~markets~Alphabet Cl A~2020-01-12~Alexis Borisy’s start-up plans to make fast followers—unique medications, protected by their own patents, that copy a drug or class of drugs~Alphabet Cl A,GOOGL,Roche Holding,ROG.EB,Blueprint Medicines,BPMC,Alexis Borisy,alternative investments,biotech,companies,health,us,biotechnology,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences,drug discovery,development,venture capital~A Biotech Veteran Thinks He Can Undersell the Entire Drug Industry~https://www.barrons.com/articles/biotech-veteran-thinks-he-can-undersell-the-entire-drug-industry-51578849551?mod=hp_LEAD_1~2020
 This conversation about the economy and markets is an excerpt from Barron’s recent Roundtable, published on Jan. 10. To read the entire discussion, click here. Barron’s: OK, it’s time put you all on the spot. What’s your prediction for U.S. GDP and the market at the end of 2020? Mario, you first. Mario Gabelli: We have a $90 trillion global economy. The U.S. is around 24%, reflecting the strength of U.S. economy and the dollar. Europe is about 22%; Japan, 6%. Europe is going to get a little stronger in 2020; Japan will be up a little bit. I’ll give developed countries 2% real growth, with the U.S. in that area, assuming we don’t have oil going to $100 a barrel. China will grow over 6% real. Overall, I see 3.2% real growth for global GDP.The markets will be up in the first half of 2020 and turn down in the last 90 days of 2020, because there will be a lot more uncertainty for 2021. A major agreement between the Democrats and Republicans on an infrastructure bill could change that outcome. That is a missing ingredient in the U.S. economic outlook for 2021. Todd Ahlsten: It’s going to be quite a volatile year. Multiple expansion will be tough to come by, so with earnings growth in the mid-single digits, a starting framework is a mid-single digit year [for stock returns]. Sonal Desai: For 2020, I’m looking at 2.5% to 2.75% [real gross domestic product growth], and agree that the VIX [the Cboe Volatility Index] will go up for a variety of reasons, political and otherwise. It takes very little to topple from a steep valuation; I would have to agree, based on where your market appreciation comes from, that mid-single digit returns on stocks sound right. Abby Joseph Cohen: With GDP at that level, what sort of interest rates do you expect? Desai: The Fed is going to keep short-term rates anchored where they are, and I continue to believe that this is a mistake, as monetary policy is too accommodative for the state of the economy. I expect the long end [of the U.S. Treasury market] to sell off a bit, on the back of inflation, despite the deflationary or disinflationary consequences of technology. The strength of labor markets argues for that. Finally, while goods price inflation has remained muted, that certainly is not the case for asset price inflation. The R-word came up quite a bit in our discussion last year, but no one has mentioned recession today. William Priest: A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP. The sum of the growth in the workforce and growth in productivity has to be a minus sign. It’s almost impossible to get that in the U.S. right now. I think U.S. real GDP growth will be around 1.5%, with overall global real GDP growth at 3% or a bit less. Meryl Witmer: The consumer is in good shape; consumers will continue to spend, and the Fed looks like it will be very cooperative. We usually say slow growth is nirvana for the market, but with valuations this high, I would not expect a robust year for the market. Everything I look at is trading where it should trade in 1½ or 2 years from now, which means valuations are 15% to 20% too high. We could have a really sideways-to-down market; if something happens to cause fear, it could really topple. Then, maybe we’d get some good valuations again. It’s good to have some cash around. Cash levels for retail investors are still kind of high, but down from last year. Henry Ellenbogen: I see modest real GDP growth in the 1.5% to 2% range. I agree with Meryl that the consumer is strong and the markets are relatively full. I am the opposite of Mario—I think the markets are going to be weak until we have some certainty, not only on the presidential election, but also on whether the Democrats take the Senate. The three swing factors for the year are the Fed, China, and the election. The Fed will remain accommodative. I don’t think China has forgotten what’s happened over the last couple of years. And there will be clarity around the election and whether there is a change in fiscal policy and taxes. Read the entire Barron’s 2020 Roundtable here.

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is expected to declare a dividend increase next week, according to financial data firm IHS Markit. The firm expects BlackRock (ticker: BLK) to boost its quarterly payout to $3.62 a share, nearly 10% above the $3.30 a share it pays now.As of Sept. 30, the firm’s assets under management totaled just under $7 trillion, up from $6.4 trillion a year earlier, helped by strong inflows in its iShares exchange-traded fund business. These passive funds, which BlackRock acquired in 2009, have been a key driver of its growth over the past decade under longtime CEO Larry Fink.Over the years, BlackRock’s top priority with its cash has been to invest in its own businesses, followed by returning capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.In January of 2019, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $3.30 a share, up 5% from $3.13.BlackRock’s consensus earnings estimate for this year is $30.98 a share, 11% higher than the $27.83 it’s expected to achieve in 2019. The company is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter and full 2019 earnings on Jan. 15.The stock, which recently yielded 2.6%, has a one-year return of about 32%.Another company that IHS Markit expects to announce a dividend increase next week is Jacobs Engineering Group (J).It’s looking for a 12% boost in the company’s quarterly payout to 19 cents a share, up 12%. The stock, which has a one-year return of about 50%, yields 0.7%.Jacobs Engineering’s various businesses include software development, data analytics and cyber security and designing infrastructure projects.

 Spotify Technology stock was down 2.7% to $151.85 on Monday after Evercore analyst Benjamin Black downgraded the stock to Underperform from In Line on concerns about its valuation and growth prospects.After falling to as low as $110 in the fall, Spotify stock (ticker: SPOT) has rebounded in the last few months after reporting a surprise third-quarter profit and encouraging subscriber growth in October. The stock nearly hit $160 last week. But investors need to be wary now, because “with the stock back now near $160, our view is the risk/reward has tilted back in favor of rewarding shorts,” Black wrote in a research report. His price target is $115.Black says Spotify is the streaming-music leader but operates in a “loss-leader” category where its peers are willing to lose money. Spotify’s competitors include Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) unit YouTube, and newer social media players such as TikTok. Those companies mostly see music as an ancillary service that can aid their businesses, whether it’s advertising or a membership business like Amazon Prime. High competition means it will be hard for Spotify to raise prices. What’s more, Spotify still depends on a few enormous music labels for its content, and those labels have substantial negotiating power.“For Spotify, material margin expansion likely remains a pipe dream,” Black wrote, “as rivals operate streaming music services at a loss to the benefit of broader ecosystems and labels act as an oligopoly.”Spotify sees podcasts as an important new growth area—and one where they can own the content, unlike music streaming. The company spent hundreds of millions of dollars last year to buy podcast production companies and tools for making podcasts. It’s now rolling out new software to allow advertisers to better track podcast listening habits. But podcasts still account for low to mid single digits of listening time and revenue growth from podcast ads has been slowing. He sees it growing to about $1 billion by 2021, and “Spotify will compete for a fraction of this total.”Black’s downgrade comes days after Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger initiated coverage of Spotify with an Underperform rating and a $137 price target.

The rally that drove Apple shares up 86% in 2019 isn’t over yet.On Monday, Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) pushed further into record territory, getting a boost from D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte, who upped his price target on Apple shares to $375, from $300, while repeating his Buy rating on the shares. In a research note Monday morning, headlined “5G(ood) Reasons There May Be More Gas Left In AAPL’s Tank,” Forte focuses in particular on expectations for the expected launch of 5G iPhones later this year.Here’s his list of five reasons to stay bullish:1. Apple should be able to generate positive smartphone unit growth for at least the next two product cycles as 5G rolls out, he says.2. Emerging opportunities in streaming video, financial services, and health care. “In our view, the maturation of the smartphone market was, in hindsight, one of the best things to happen to Apple, because it forced the company to pursue noncore opportunities to drive future growth,” he writes.3. iPhone boost from Apple Card: “One of the benefits to consumers who signed up for an Apple Card (its branded credit card) is the ability to purchase an iPhone and pay for it in monthly installments without paying interest,” he writes. “We believe this could be a catalyst for iPhone unit sales for several years.”4. Motivated carriers rolling out 5G: “We believe Apple should benefit from wireless carriers’ desire to earn returns on their significant investment spending for infrastructure and spectrum to make 5G a reality,” he writes. “As a result, they may be offering greater incentives to consumers to upgrade their devices to leverage their 5G networks.”5. Buybacks: “While this likely contributed to the stock’s strong 2019, Apple ended the September 2019 quarter with $79 billion remaining on its last share repurchase authorization.”Forte also notes two risks for Apple shares. The first being high hopes. He noted that “[the] iPhone 11 launch had the lowest expectations of any in its history, in our view. By way of comparison, expectations are much higher for the stock and its next iPhone product launch.” The second risk for Apple is tariffs. He is “still monitoring the potential for tariffs to negatively impact Apple’s operating performance...short of a full deal between the U.S. and China, we see this as a persistent risk for the stock.”Apple shares are up 0.6% to $312.16 Monday morning. The stock is up about 6% so far in 2020. Write to Eric J.

 Shopify stock rose Monday after Credit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick said he is getting more bullish over its shares.Shopify stock soared 187% last year. Investors are increasingly optimistic about its e-commerce infrastructure platform, services, and tools. The company uses cloud computing to offer better reliability, lower upfront costs, and scalability to its merchant customers, generating revenue through a combination of monthly subscription and transaction fees.On Monday, Zelnick reaffirmed his Outperform rating for Shopify shares, predicting strong growth from the company’s offerings this year. He also raised his price target to $450 from $370 for the stock.“As we enter 2020, we take this opportunity to refresh our valuation of Shopify,” he wrote. “We anticipate Shopify will continue to execute against its secular growth opportunities in 2020.”Shopify stock was up 3.4% to $443.67 on Monday.Last June, Shopify took a big step toward becoming a viable alternative to Amazon.com (AMZN). It unveiled the Shopify Fulfillment Network, which gives merchants cheaper shipping, warehousing, and picking/packaging services.The analyst said the next two catalysts for the stock include its fourth-quarter earnings report and any updates on the progress of its Shopify Fulfillment Network. Other Wall Street analysts are mixed on Shopify shares. About 48% of them have ratings of Buy or the equivalent on the stock, while 41% have Hold ratings, according to FactSet.

 Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill is throwing in the towel on his bearish call for Nvidia stock. In November, Nvidia (ticker: NVDA) reported financial results above expectations. It posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.78 for its fiscal third quarter versus the Wall Street consensus of $1.58, according to FactSet. At the time, the chip maker generated revenue of $3.01 billion, down 5% year over year but better than the $2.92 billion average analyst estimate. The company’s stock rose 76% last year as investors anticipated a return to growth.On Monday, Gill raised his rating for Nvidia to Hold from Underperform, predicting strong demand from the chip maker’s data-center business. The analyst had downgraded the stock last January.“After three consecutive quarters of negative [year-over-year] growth, we think data center will reach an inflection point” in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter ending this month “and return to Y/Y growth,” he wrote. The analyst is also optimistic over Nvidia’s gaming business as more titles use its “raytracing” feature, which offers better lighting effects. Despite the better trends, Gill isn’t ready to recommend buying the chip stock, because of its elevated valuation. He doesn’t have a price target for the shares.“While we could see the shares rise in the near-term on estimate revisions, we contend the shares are fully valued at 34x our [fiscal] 2021 earnings estimate (near multi-year high),” he wrote.Other Wall Street analysts are also positive on Nvidia. About 73% of them have ratings of Buy or the equivalent on the stock, while 23% have Hold ratings, according to FactSet.Nvidia stock was up 2.2%, at $249.63 Monday morning. The S&P 500 was up 0.2%.

The U.S. and China are set to sign a much-anticipated “phase one trade deal” on Wednesday, a move that is expected to quell the threat of further tariffs—at least for a while. But certain sectors and companies could still see plenty of volatility as the U.S. and China wrangle over their relationship in areas beyond trade.Markets have already rallied since President Donald Trump heralded the deal in the Oval Office last month. The iShares MSCI China ETF (ticker: MCHI) is up almost 9% over the past month, compared with a 3.2% gain for the S&P 500. The full details of the 86-page deal haven’t been disclosed, but Clete Willems, a former trade negotiator in the Trump administration who is familiar with the agreement, says it includes substantive structural commitments that are likely to be broader and deeper than people expect, along with the reduction in some tariffs that has already been announced. There are five broad areas to the interim deal. First, it is expected to include enforceable commitments from China to halt so-called forced tech transfers, the practice of requiring companies to turn over their intellectual property, enter joint ventures, or license technology at below-market terms, according to Willems, who is now a partner at the law firm Akin Gump. Also expected in the deal: Detailed provisions for China to undertake appropriate judicial proceedings to enforce trade-secret laws; patent extensions for U.S. pharmaceuticals in China; commitments by Beijing to not manipulate its currency, matching those in other trade pacts; and agreement by the Chinese to buy more agricultural products, with commitments to use science-based risk assessments when considering bans on imports of U.S. chicken or beef, for example, Willems says.The deal is also expected to includes measures related to opening up China’s financial sector—an area Beijing has been addressing as it tries to overhaul its banking system. On the same front are provisions to make it easier for foreign financial firms to get licenses to operate in China. Still outstanding are measures related to cyber intrusions, subsidies, and issues related to state-owned enterprises and antimonopoly measures. These are often described as the thorny issues in the trade relationship because tackling them would require the Chinese to change industrial policy. Enforcement of the initial deal will be through a multipart consultation process, although either side can still resort to tariffs if the consultations don’t succeed. How completely China has followed through at the local level on commitments made by the national government has often been an issue in the past. “To the extent there is any concern about the enforcement mechanism it has to do with its durability, not rigor,” Willems says. “At some level, China is going to have to do what says it is going to do.” He said the next step for the U.S. should be to organize a multilateral, international effort to push China on the more difficult issues outstanding.The deal is set to be signed on Wednesday by Trump and Vice Premier Liu He, China’s lead trade negotiator. For investor sentiment, the tone set at the event will matter, perhaps even more than the details. If Trump’s rhetoric “is positive—anticipating Chinese compliance and progress—that should lead to a modest boost to corporate confidence and capital expenditures in China, as well as a more positive approach toward China by foreign equities investors,” says Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia. “If Trump says he is skeptical China will live up to its part of the bargain and he emphasizes the threat of new tariffs, then the overhang of a full-blown trade war won’t be lifted.”Tariffs still are in place on a wide swath of Chinese goods, and remain a drag on the economy, although the impact has been more muted than expected. Average U.S. tariffs on goods from China will stay at 19.3%—roughly six times higher than before the trade war began in 2018, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Most strategists and policy watchers don’t expect the administration to resume escalating the levies as the U.S. election nears. While that may mean fewer marketwide swings in response to developments on the U.S.-China front, certain sectors—and companies—may continue to see volatility as the relationship resets in other areas, especially technology. Corporate executives will face challenges as national security, economic policy and technology become more intertwined. Those advising companies are keeping a close eye on new export controls this year for emerging and foundational technologies that could rattle U.S. companies involved in these sectors. Tensions for technology companies and their Chinese operations are likely to ebb and flow, says Paul Triolo, who heads up global tech policy at Eurasia Group.Last year, the U.S. sent shares of chip makers and other U.S. suppliers to the telecom-equipment maker reeling when Washington placed Huawei Technologies on its export-restrictions list last year. Now, the Commerce Department is considering changes that would close loopholes that let some companies continue as suppliers to Huawei, Triolo says. That could drive some companies to move more research and development outside of the U.S. over time, and it has the potential to hit short-term sales, Triolo says. He said more controls are expected in areas such as quantum computing and 3-D printing—and could later include tools for semiconductor manufacturing and design. Other Chinese companies could find themselves on the export-restrictionslist this year. U.S. legislators are concerned, for example, about drone maker DJI, and how it handles data from its industrial drone, with some describing it as the “next Huawei,” Triolo says. The company has been working with customers and regulators to address and poke holes in these suspicions, but Triolo says many Chinese tech companies are now presumed to be guilty simply because they are based in China. There could also be measures against companies handling personal data. ByteDance, with its popular TikTok app, is already in the U.S.’s crosshairs. The bottom line is that while concern about tariffs on Chinese goods may receded for a while, the ups and downs in the Beijing-Washington relationship aren’t going away. The uncertainty is likely to keep companies caught in the middle on edge as they try to plan their investment spending. ~technology~nan~2020-01-13~Wednesday’s signing of an agreement is expected to quell the threat of further tariffs, for now, but areas such as tech could still see volatility as Washington and Beijing wrangle over their relationship.~trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,trade barriers,restrictions,government bodies,executive branch,asia,economy and policy,emerging markets,technology,markets,us,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,exchange traded funds,financial services,investing,securities~A U.S.-China Trade Deal Is About to Be Signed.

Stocks have shrugged off rising geopolitical tensions early in 2020. There appears to be no stopping the recent rally. But is it a head fake? Investors, after all, shouldn’t forget about the January effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 1% year to date. The S&P 500 has risen 1.1%. The Nasdaq Composite has climbed 2.3%. Strong gains to start the year. Don’t forget the market rose 7.9% in January 2019. The January effect is the idea stocks tend to rise in the first month of the year because of fund flows. January is bonus time. (For some Americans.) That means people are saving and investing excess earnings. So is the effect real? Or something to invest in or be wary of? Those are three separate questions. January is a big month for cash coming into the market, according to industry data provider ICI. Both January 2018 and January 2019, for instance, were the biggest month of the year for stock and bond inflows. When money comes into the market it creates a buy order as mutual funds put new money to work. And stocks rise in January about 60% of the time. Case closed. Maybe not. The stock market tends to rise over time, reflecting the growth of the overall economy. The market rises about seven out of 10 years and the chances any one month posts a positive stock return is about 60%. Suddenly January doesn’t look so special. Funds flows matters, but they are like high short interest. It accelerates a trend, but isn’t usually the underlying cause of stock price movements. A stock is heavily shorted when bearish investors borrow and sell more shares than the average stock in the S&P. Heavily shorted stocks are typically more volatile than average.Moves to close out short bets can cause stock prices to rise by providing a flurry of buy orders. The short covering exacerbates whatever caused the stock to jump in the first place. But it doesn’t cause the jump. Fund flows can have a similar effect. So what does the strong January mean for investors? When stocks rise in January there is a better than 60% chance the year will end in the green. That is to say the overall impact of January on the year is negligible. It’s just another month. At least the January effect is one less thing to think about. But why do investors think about this stuff at all? The January effect, after all, has its own Wikipedia page. Predicting the stock market is hard. And everyone wants an investing edge. It’s better, however, to focus on what investors can control, like trying to buy good stocks that fit a time-tested strategy. Leave daily, or monthly, stock fluctuations to the traders.

Secretary of the Air Force Barbara M. Barrett disclosed that she and her husband Craig Barrett sold a number of stock investments, as she had pledged to.Secretary Barrett disclosed the sale of more than 1.8 million shares of Intel (ticker: INTC), 182,512 Exponent (EXPO) shares, and some smaller divestitures. She reported the sale in a Dec. 13 letter to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, although the exact timing of the sales weren’t disclosed. The letter was made available to the public later.At Dec. 13’s closing prices, those Intel shares were valued at $104.7 million, and the Exponent shares, $12.2 million.Craig Barrett is a former CEO and chairman of Intel, and Sec.

 Tesla became the largest car company in the U.S. ever this past week, with a market value of $86 billion. That’s impressive, but there are caveats. Tesla stock still has a way to go to threaten General Motors back when it ruled the Fortune 500, though turning historical numbers into modern values is tricky at best. The Fortune 500 list debuted in 1955, with GM at No. 1. GM’s stock was worth $13 billion, based on 276 million shares and a closing price of $46 a share. The S&P 500 index closed 1955 at 45, with a total value of $400 billion. (Today’s S&P 500 totals almost $28 trillion.) A dollar in 1955 is worth $10 today, notes the Bureau of Labor Statistics, making GM’s outstanding stock in 1955 worth $130 billion today, 51% higher than Tesla’s. Still, that may be lowballing 1955’s GM, then the largest U.S. company by sales and one of the largest by value. Today, the market-value champ is Apple, worth $1.3 trillion, 4.3% of the S&P. In 1955, GM was 3% of the S&P, implying a 2020 value of $840 billion—though that may not be an apt analogy, given the very different businesses.In 1955, GM sales topped $12 billion. Retailer Walmart’s , Fortune’s current No. 1, latest 12-month sales of $520 billion are 43 times larger. That multiple suggests a GM value of $500 billion. Focusing on sales, however, ignores profits. GM made $1.2 billion in 1955 profits, for a net margin of 10%. Walmart’s margin is less than 2%; Apple’s, more than 20%. Profits ultimately determine value. The 1955 GM generated half of Apple’s profit from a dollar of sales, producing a valuation of $650 billion. By any measure, Tesla still has a way to go. Stocks bounced around as the week began, buffeted by Middle East turmoil. They crashed after news of the Iranian missile strike on Tuesday, recovering after it became clear that a hot war was not beginning. Stocks hit new highs but wavered as nonfarm payrolls came in a little low at 145,000. For the week, the Dow industrials gained 0.66%, to 28,823.77; the S&P 500 picked up 0.94%, to 3265,35; and the Nasdaq surged 1.75%, to 9178.86. Iran launched ICBM strikes in response to the killing of Gen. Qassim Soleimani, targeting two Iraqi air bases, al-Asad and Erbil. There were no casualties. President Trump, who had warned that an Iranian attack would lead to a U.S. response, chose not to respond militarily but to slap on more sanctions. Earlier in the week, the Iraqi Parliament voted to expel U.S. troops. Critics questioned the intelligence driving the attack. The House passed a measure to limit the administration’s ability to go to war with Iran; the Senate is working on one, as well. A Ukraine International airliner crashed outside Tehran’s airport hours after the missile strikes, killing all 176 people on board. Iranians say the plane was on fire when it went down, but satellite and video evidence suggests it was hit by a missile. Iranian officials have recovered the black box and say they may pass it along to a third country. The plane was a Boeing 737-800, a predecessor of the 737 MAX. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared that he had the GOP votes to move forward on an impeachment trial that would begin without witnesses. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled that she would pass articles of impeachment over to the Senate this week. Meanwhile, former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who attended key meetings on the Ukraine situation, said he would testify in a Senate trial if subpoenaed—and if there are witnesses. Carlos Ghosn, the former chief of the Nissan -Renault-Mitsubishi alliance, spoke publicly in Lebanon for the first time after his escape from Japan in an audio-equipment trunk. Ghosn had been awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct. He attacked the Japanese legal system and blamed a “handful of malevolent actors” at Nissan. Japanese prosecutors also issued a warrant for Ghosn’s wife, on perjury charges.

American Water Works AWK-NYSE Buy Price $120 on Jan. 8 by Janney Montgomery Scott American Water Works’ acquisition activity has been robust recently, with five announced deals in the past 30 days, totaling $108 million. Illinois and Pennsylvania accounted for the bulk of the deals, with New Jersey also generating a small transaction. This provides reinforcement to our positive investment thesis, and we maintain our Buy rating and $153 fair value on the shares, based on a price/earnings ratio of just over 35 times our 2021 earnings-per-share estimate of $4.32.Newtek Business Services NEWT-Nasdaq Underperform Price $22.83 on Jan. 8 by Raymond James We are downgrading our rating to Underperform from Market Perform.We believe that there are a number of earnings headwinds ahead, with difficult growth targets in the Small Business Administration 7(a) lending business and a tougher comparison for Newtek’s merchant services segment. There is potential for upside versus our expectations from the conventional lending joint venture, but we do not believe that opportunity overwhelms the risk we see from other segments at this stage.While there are always other levers to pull, such as one-time dividends from control subsidiaries, such earnings sources could result in a weaker quality of returns and [might] impact the sustainability of the current premium multiple valuation. Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL-NYSE Overweight Price $130.44 on Jan. 7 by J.P. Morgan We are raising our 2020 year-end price target to $154, from $135, on a slightly higher 2021 estimated P/E multiple of 13 times, from 11.4 times previously (no change to estimates).A higher multiple is warranted, given that Royal proved in 2019 that it could comfortably grow core yields in the current elevated-capacity growth environment. Thirteen times is 1.0-1.5 times below the company’s long-term average multiple and still well below the broader market multiple, and fair, in our view, given where we are in the economic cycle (late), and the inherently significant operating leverage in the cruise-line business model. Cytokinetics CYTK-Nasdaq Buy Price: $10.83 on Jan. 6 by H.C. Wainwright & Co.This morning, Cytokinetics announced the opening of enrollment in the Redwood-HCM study, a Phase 2 clinical trial testing CK-274 for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [HCM, a genetic disorder characterized by an abnormally thick heart muscle].CK-274 has been optimized to ensure rapid symptom relief for HCM patients, which is particularly important in this patient population, and very valuable compared with gene-therapy approaches (which probably require longer periods of time, after administration, before becoming effective in relieving symptoms). We reiterate our Buy rating and price target of $30. Lyft LYFT-Nasdaq Buy Price $43.58 on Jan. 2 by CFRAOur Buy opinion reflects our outlook on Lyft’s attractive end-markets/geographic exposure, scalable and recurring-based business model, as well as our expectation for considerable margin expansion through 2021. We see Lyft taking market share in the still nascent mobility-as-a-service space, with overseas expansion as a potential significant growth opportunity long term (the company is currently operating in the U.S. and Canada only). We like Lyft’s initiatives and partnerships [for] autonomous capabilities. Risks include slower-than-expected adoption of mobility-as-a-service, lower-than-expected revenue per active rider, greater-than-projected insurance costs, higher-than-expected expense growth, and greater-than-forecast intermediate-term cash burn.Our 12-month $70 target price is based on our discounted-cash-flow analysis. Bio-Techne TECH-Nasdaq Overweight (Volatile) Price $217.16 on Jan. 7 by StephensSince 2013, Bio-Techne has expanded its portfolio of assets from legacy reagents/diagnostics, moving into instruments and new clinical applications, which has resulted in growth accelerating from the low-single to the low-double digits. We see this continuing as Bio-Techne begins to benefit from cell- and gene-therapy capabilities, along with Exosome (liquid biopsy), in coming years. All of which should result in Bio-Techne achieving its targets of $1.2 billion in revenue and 40% margins by 2023. Since CEO Chuck Kummeth joined the company in 2013, Bio-Techne has transformed into a more-diversified, higher-growth life-science company. Given the outlook for accelerating organic growth and expanding margins, we [give it] an Overweight (Volatile) rating, with a $250 price target.To be considered for this section, material should be sent to Research@barrons.com.~technology~nan~2020-01-10~Also, Wall Street views on the shares of Newtek Business Services, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Cytokinetics, Lyft, and Bio-Techne~wall street research,Cytokinetics,CYTK,Royal Caribbean Cruises,RCL,Lyft,LYFT,American Water Works,AWK,Bio-Techne,TECH,Newtek Business Services,NEWT,biotechnology,companies,department,health,technology,investing,magazine,research reports,transportation,utilities,water utilities,financial investments,investment advice,financial services,securities,marine passenger transport,sharing,on-demand economy services~Wall Street Views on American Water Works, Royal Caribbean and Others~https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-investment-allure-of-american-water-works-51578705000?mod=hp_LEAD_1~2020
Nearly 200,000 people gathered in Las Vegas for CES this past week, as thousands of companies showed off a remarkable range of technological wonders. There were TVs of every shape and size. Samsung (ticker: 005930) demoed a 292-inch display—perfect if you want to open a drive-in. The Korean electronics giant also showed a TV that can rotate vertically, all the better to watch content intended for smartphones. While PCs may be fading, there were plenty of new models, like the Lenovo X1 Fold, which folds vertically like a book. CES’ metamorphosis into a car show continues. There were dozens of autonomous and electric vehicles, including a concept car from Sony (SNE)—yes Sony—and the futuristic Mercedes AVTR, with a design based on the movie Avatar. There were connected consumer and health gadgets of every description, including more than a few Web-connected toothbrushes and a weirdly abundant selection of vibrators. Deere’s (DE) booth featured a gigantic crop sprayer with arms extending 120 feet. Brunswick (BC) managed to get a 40-foot power boat with three outboard motors into its booth. Hyundai and Bell both showed gigantic prototype heli-taxis. Meanwhile, a few miles across town at the Venetian, there were more than 1,000 start-ups from dozens of countries.There’s no simple way to sum up CES 2020, but a few themes emerged from the noise. Here are my five takeaways: 5G is going to be a big deal, but maybe not in the way you think. This is the year that fifth-generation wireless technology hits the mainstream. Qualcomm (QCOM) President Christiano Amon said last week that 45 operators around the world have deployed 5G; he predicts 200 million 5G smartphones will be sold in 2020, growing from there. “5G is a multifaceted technology, a foundational piece of everything for the next decade,” says Simon Segars, CEO of chip design house ARM. The real opportunity is going to be at the edge of the network, where companies of every stripe will take advantage of 5G’s ability to connect a million devices to a single cell site. John Harrison, global sector lead for media and entertainment at EY, the parent of accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young, said 5G was “front and center” in discussions with his clients at the show. But nagging questions remain. For one, the real power of 5G involves millimeter wave radio spectrum, which can carry signals at high speeds, but only short distances. It’s not a real option for covering cities and suburbs with 5G signals. For most people, 5G will come on slower “sub 6” networks that won’t be a lot faster than LTE, the current standard. And while everyone expects killer 5G apps, no one has a clue what they’ll be. Autonomous driving is a long way off, but ADAS is coming on strong. The conventional wisdom on autonomous driving has shifted. Few people think we’ll have autonomous “robo taxis” soon. Maybe CES 2030. But there’s growing appreciation for ADAS—advanced driver assistance systems—which will allow the car to take over in certain situations. Nvidia (NVDA), Qualcomm, and Intel’s (INTC) Mobileye all showed off autonomous driving platforms at the show, with a specific focus on ADAS. Anshuman Saxena, senior director for ADAS at Qualcomm, says that Level 5 autonomy—full self-driving—“is still not realistically going to be available in the near term,” and won’t arrive until the industry and government sort out insurance, liability, and regulatory issues. “They’re unsolved problems at this point,” he says. “And even from a technology point of view, there are constraints.” He says that most Level 5 prototypes have trunks full of PCs, fans, and power supplies, which make them impractical for broad adoption. “Enhanced driving is the sweet spot,” he says. The future of television is content, not big screens. Traditionally, the heart of CES has been the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center, where cutting-edge TVs are displayed. But this year, the more important TV discussions were taking place across town at the Aria hotel, where TV networks, advertisers, and other entertainment firms debated business models. Subscription streaming services continue to grow, while cable is declining. Aside from NFL games, ratings for ad-supported content are in free fall. The Internet of Things is here. For years, CES has been showing off devices connected to the network for no particular reason, like refrigerators with web browsers embedded in their doors. But this year, connected devices got more practical, particularly around health, sleep, and home automation. The trend is going to get a boost from the arrival of 5G and its promise to connect everything, and from our increasingly sophisticated ability to collect and analyze data. On Thursday, I went to a packed dinner for the Internet of Things Consortium with 70 executives from companies like Google, iRobot, Comcast, Henkel, Nestlé and Colgate, all building network-connected gizmos. There were lots of nods in the room when a Comcast exec suggested that consumers were perfectly happy to share data in exchange for free services—and therein lies tech’s greatest risk. The privacy problems are growing. In a session on privacy that included executives from both Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB), FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter stole the show. She made it clear that, given the steady drumbeat of news on privacy breaches, “it would be impossible to conclude that enough is being done.” There was widespread discussion about CCPA, the new California consumer privacy law, and worries about what could happen if Congress fails to adopt a federal privacy statute, leading to a patchwork of conflicting state laws. “People are not taking these threats as seriously as they should,” says longtime tech analyst Rob Enderle. On Tuesday, as the show floor opened for business, a hacker attacked the city of Las Vegas’ computer system. When it comes to CES, what happens in Vegas definitely doesn’t stay in Vegas.

 Apple was a blessing to investors in 2019. Now it has become a trillion-dollar headache. In soaring 86% last year, Apple (ticker: AAPL) added a staggering $579 billion in new market value. That 12-month gain is more than the total value of all but four other companies in the S&P 500 index. At its current $1.4 trillion market cap, Apple is swamping public indexes and individual portfolios.A typical diversification strategy would argue for taking profits. But there’s nothing typical about Apple, which continues to defy the law of large numbers. When evaluating the stock, it makes sense to start with valuation. After years of looking cheap, Apple shares are now pricey. The stock trades for 24 times Wall Street’s projected fiscal-2020 earnings per share of $13.03, compared with 18 times for the S&P 500. Apple’s stock has traded at an average forward earnings multiple of 14 over the past 10 years, according to FactSet.“We struggle to see material upside from here, given that Apple is now the most expensive it’s been since 2010,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote this past week. Read more: Barron’s Roundtable: Almost No Chance of a Recession Just 13 months ago, Barron’s picked Apple as one its top 10 picks for 2019. But that’s when the stock traded at 13 times forward earnings. Leuthold Group analyst Phil Segner notes that Apple surpassed 4% of the S&P 500’s total market value last October. It’s the sixth time Apple has crossed that threshold. In the other instances, Segner calculates, Apple has underperformed the S&P 500 by an average of nine percentage points over the following 12-month stretch. “The market gets jazzed up over potential new products and revenue streams, but once they come to fruition, they sell on the news,” he says. Segner is skeptical that Apple can outperform the market from here, adding that “the upside looks limited.”Meanwhile, the soaring valuation doesn’t match the fundamentals. Apple sales—an estimated $275 billion—are likely to be up just 6% for the current fiscal year ending in September. Apple is trading like a start-up, but its growth looks more like a regulated utility. And yet Wall Street analysts are rushing to raise their target prices. Aside from simply keeping up with the stock, bullish analysts cite optimism about Apple’s potential in wearables, services, and fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless. At current prices, though, the growth areas are more risk than opportunity. A 5G-enabled iPhone is likely to debut later this year, but 5G’s utility will be limited for the foreseeable future, with networks still in their infancy. Apple will now spend 2020 dealing with high expectations. J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee recently estimated that the stock is pricing in 5% upside to the current iPhone unit-sales consensus.Despite the noteworthy success of AirPods and the Apple Watch, Apple remains a story about the iPhone, which still represents a majority of the company’s sales.In its September quarter, Apple reported a year-over-year iPhone sales decline of 9%. The company’s operating profits actually declined 3% year over year. Apple’s earnings-per-share gain of 4% was driven by significant stock buybacks, which reduced shares outstanding by roughly 6% over the past year. While the company still has about $100 billion of net cash to return to shareholders, buybacks will probably slow as the cash balance shrinks.For suddenly flush Apple shareholders, Segner suggests paring down positions and waiting for a period of underperformance to repurchase the stock. Financial advisor Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines, cautioned against the risk of having too much money concentrated in a single stock, especially after a large one-year rally. “It is unrealistic to expect any investment to maintain that type of growth,” he says. “A prudent approach argues for rebalancing the portfolio. That means selling some and redistributing those assets into other assets that didn’t perform as well.”Investors can take profits on their Apple 2019 gains and still have a significant holding in the stock, all while hedging against the risks of pricey Apple shares. Here are some ideas. For Apple investors that want exposure to faster-growing tech names, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) is a good bet. The foundry company makes chips for external customers that need the most advanced manufacturing capabilities. TSM’s client list includes Apple and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), so it benefits from the success of both companies.The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector exchange-traded fund (IGV) is another good diversification tool, given Apple’s hardware focus. Top holdings in the iShares software ETF include Adobe (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT).Finally, for investors looking for higher return potential—admittedly with higher risk—Barron’srecently highlighted shares of Datadog (DDOG). The company is a leader in monitoring cloud applications, putting it in a prime position to benefit from the cloud’s continued growth. The good news for Apple shareholders is that they’ve already won. It’s all table stakes from here on out.

Casper Sleep, the tech startup known for selling mattresses on the internet, is planning to go public.On Friday, the company filed its initial public offering document with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Casper applied to list the company’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “CSPR.”“People spend more time sleeping than on any other single activity throughout their lives,” the company said. “We believe sleep is rapidly becoming the third pillar of wellness and is poised to undergo the same massive transformation that fitness and nutrition have as they became major consumer categories.”Here’s some key information from the IPO filing. Strong Growth, But Big Losses The first thing investors look for when a company files to go public are the financials. Casper’s sales have grown 46% annually from 2016 to 2018. It generated $358 million in sales in 2018. But the company loses money. It lost $92 million in 2018 and lost $73 million in 2017. ‘Global Sleep Economy’ Is Massive Casper cites a Frost & Sullivan market size forecast of $432 billion for the “Global Sleep Economy” in 2019. The research firm predicts the market will grow 6% annually to $585 billion by 2024.The 2019 “Global Sleep Economy” includes $106 billion for bedroom furniture, $81 billion for mattresses, and $98 billion for bedding, among other categories. Physical Stores and Partnerships Casper is not an internet-only operation. It has 60 retail stores in the U.S. and Canada, along with 18 retail partners including Amazon (ticker: AMZN), Costco (COST), and Target (TGT). “Our presence in physical retail stores has proven complementary to our e-commerce channel,” the filing said.The company noted e-commerce sales in cities with retail stores have grown 100% faster on average than cities without its retail stores. Over time the company believes there is an opportunity to have more than 200 retail stores in North America. A Million Customers Casper has more than 1.4 million customers and sells to consumers in 7 countries.

BofA Securities is getting more optimistic about its bullish call on Nvidia. In November, Nvidia (ticker: NVDA) reported financial results above expectations. It posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.78 for its fiscal third quarter versus the Wall Street consensus of $1.58, according to FactSet. At the time, the chip maker generated revenue of $3.01 billion, down 5% year over year but better than the $2.92 billion average analyst estimate.On Friday, BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his Buy rating on Nvidia stock after hosting a meeting with the company. He also raised his price target for the shares to $300 from $275.“The tone of the meeting was positive and increased our confidence that NVDA is ahead of a substantial growth re-acceleration in CY20,” he wrote.The analyst estimates the company’s sales to data centers will rise by more than 30% this year versus a 3% decline for 2019. He is also positive about Nvidia’s artificial-intelligence, gaming, and automotive end markets.“We think this speaks to the sustainability of the underlying secular demand for...AI workloads [as they] evolve from primarily image classification to the next wave of conversational AI/Natural Language Processing,” Arya wrote. Other Wall Street analysts are also positive on Nvidia. About 73% of them have ratings of Buy or the equivalent on the stock, while 20% have Hold ratings, according to FactSet. Nvidia stock was up 1.5%, at $246.56, in recent trading. The S&P 500 was flat.

 Grubhub stock is falling after the online food-delivery company said it doesn’t plan to sell itself.

Australia’s horrific brush fires may prove a catalyst to kick the global battle with climate change into higher gear. If so, investors should look again at China, particularly the Chinese companies dominating sales of solar-energy equipment. At least 80% of solar modules and panels worldwide are produced by Chinese manufacturers. Neither U.S. tariffs, which affect just 10% of the global market, nor market competition seems likely to shake that position in the near term. “China’s dominant role is the status quo,” says Kevin Tu, a Beijing-based fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “The companies excel throughout the value chain from silicon to finished panels.”Not that stocks like JinkoSolar Holding (ticker: JKS), Xinyi Solar Holdings (968.Hong Kong) and Daqo New Energy (DQ) have had a smooth ride. As in any emerging industry—global solar installations increased tenfold during the 2010s—producers have had trouble calibrating supply to demand, and staying profitable. The sector pitched into crisis in mid-2018, when China’s government slashed its own subsidies for solar. Domestic installations fell by more than 15%, and stocks dropped by a third or more. Chinese demand contracted again in 2019, but the rest of the world more than made up for it. Solar-module exports from China jumped 90% in the first half of last year on vigorous orders ranging from the Netherlands to Vietnam, and 2020 should be better, says Corrine Lin, chief analyst at PV Infolink in Taiwan. Economics, not ephemeral government policy, is increasingly driving the market now, says Philip Shen, senior researcher for clean technology at Roth Capital Partners. The Chinese crash forced equipment prices down by a quarter, pushing solar toward the critical benchmark of “grid parity” with fossil-fuel power in many parts of the world. “We’re entering a new era for solar, when more and more demand is unsubsidized,” he says. “We see earnings quality steadily improving in the years ahead.” Picking stocks for this dawning new epoch is not simple following a rally late last year. Will Riley, who runs the Guinness Atkinson Alternative Energy fund, is wary of commoditization among cellular-equipment producers, and is searching for companies with a defensible market niche. These include Xinyi, the premier producer of solar glass, and Daqo, “one of the lowest-cost polysilicon manufacturers.” He has dumped JinkoSolar, the top module supplier, for the moment as too expensive. The shares have jumped by half over the past two months. One company lagging its peers is Canadian Solar (CSIQ), which combines China-centered module production with three dozen actual solar-energy projects, mostly in North America. Shares are up a mere 33% for the past year. The company could boost performance by selling projects and returning cash to shareholders, analysts say. China’s near-monopoly on solar equipment illustrates the complexities of disentangling the country’s good and bad effects on the rest of the world. Heavy state subsidies certainly put the industry on its feet. As recently as 2017, U.S. and European competitors were the best in the business, PV Infolink’s Lin says. Yet the ingenuity and economy of the privately owned Chinese companies are making solar prices competitive way ahead of schedule. Columbia’s Tu expects a political backlash eventually. “This is not sustainable,” he says. “We could see retaliation by some Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [rich Western] countries.” For now, there are some interesting investment prospects.

 Here’s a look at business news you might have missed from China, the world’s second-largest economy. Taiwan Votes Amid China’s Growing Shadow Taiwan, Asia’s most lively democracy, will choose its president on Saturday, and neighboring China looms as large as ever.After a year of trailing in polls, incumbent Tsai Ing-wen has come from behind and is poised to win a second term as Taiwan’s president. Though her liberal party suffered losses in recent elections, the island’s preferences have quickly shifted—and many say an important factor is China’s heavy-handed response to Hong Kong’s recent protests for democratic reforms.Taiwan is a self-ruled democracy, but Beijing claims it as a renegade province, and it advocates for their reunification. This tension has dominated their relationship since the 1949 split. Yet China is now Taiwan’s biggest trading partner, and even voters who don’t want to be ruled under communism see the dollar signs of a closer cross-strait connection.This has been a sticky issue for Tsai’s more liberal, anti-China party in the past.Her China-friendly opponent, Han Kuo-yu, is a colorful figure who many compare to Donald Trump. He was a good bet to win until voters began questioning his coziness with China amid the robust protests in Hong Kong, a territory that shares the unique similarity with Taiwan of being a Chinese-populated democracy. The U.S. switched its recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, but it remains the island’s biggest arms provider, to China’s chagrin. China’s Trade Boss Is Coming to Washington to Sign Phase-One Deal There may be a ceasefire in the trade war. China’s top trade official is set to head to Washington next week to sign the first phase of a U.S.-China trade deal.Vice Premier Liu He is a member of China’s elite Politburo and is normally dispatched only for the country’s most important engagements. Though President Trump recently said the signing was imminent, China confirmed the move only Thursday.The agreement is symbolically big but minor in its impact. It shows the world’s two largest economies may be willing to reduce their trade tensions, but will only slightly lower tariffs and boost bilateral purchases. Tesla Begins Delivery of Cars in China Tesla delivered its first China-made cars to customers this week, as it aggressively attempts to take a leading position in the world’s largest auto market.The company’s Shanghai-based factory rolled out a cheaper than expected Model 3 after it secured a substantial tax break from Chinese regulators, a concession amid Beijing’s scrapping of subsidies for the country’s electric car-makers.The Model 3 has been one of the best-selling electric cars in the U.S. for years, and its compact size may bode even better for the Chinese market. CEO Elon Musk said a larger crossover utility vehicle, called the Model Y, was forthcoming, at about 100,000 to 200,000 more yuan.China’s car market is experiencing a painful period of contraction after 30 years of rapid growth. On top of that, regulators recently ended subsidies for electric vehicles in the industry, though Tesla was reportedly given generous land and loan rates for it so-called Gigafactory. Musk seemed undeterred by the country’s auto slowdown, showcasing numerous dance moves at the Shanghai plant’s rollout this week. U.S Report Urges Sanctions on China Officials and Companies An influential U.S. government-supported commission is urging lawmakers to toughen sanctions against Chinese officials accused of involvement in human-rights abuses.The report comes after the U.S. Senate failed to pass a House bill penalizing Chinese figures involved in human rights issues, such as China’s forced detention of an estimated million Muslim Uyghur minorities into concentration camps.Notable in the commission’s new report is an emphasis on what it characterized as China’s efforts to influence U.S. elections, university courses, and funding of American institutions.

It’s a tale of two Samsung s.This week, the Korean electronics giant projected fourth-quarter sales of 59 trillion won—about $51 billion—with operating profit of 7.1 trillion won—$6.1 billion. The estimate would put sales about flat with the year ago quarter, while profits would be down 34%, though that’s better than what analysts were expecting. In reporting third-quarter results in October, Samsung Electronics (ticker: 005930.Korea) said that demand for components was likely to “turn sluggish general amid weak seasonal effects” in the fourth quarter, with higher marketing expenses to drive year-end smartphone sales.For investors, Samsung is all about memory chips and Android phones—there’s a widespread expectation that the company will benefit in 2020 from a combination of both improving memory chip prices and growing demand for 5G smartphones. But at this week’s CES tech conference in Las Vegas, the focus was on the other Samsung—the television company. In a gigantic display in the middle of the Central Hall in the Las Vegas Convention Center, Samsung is showing off a flurry of sleek OLED and 8K televisions. That includes a line called The Wall which can link together multiple micro LED displays to produce truly enormous screens. At the CES booth and at a press event earlier in the week, the company displayed a truly enormous 292-inch display. The fact that no one has a wall big enough for the 292-inch version of The Wall, and the fact that Samsung isn’t actually selling The Wall just yet is besides the point. In the battle for bigness, Samsung has come out on top.Samsung also wins the battle for weirdest TV of the year—the Sero operates like a giant smartphone. It comes mounted on a stand with a pivot that allows consumers to switch to portrait mode from the usual landscape mode—it’s the perfect TV for someone who wants to watch mobile phone content on the big screen.There were memory products and smartphones in the Samsung booth, too, if you looked hard enough. But what drew the crowds were ever-bigger televisions. For a week in Vegas, what matters to Samsung is TVs. But once CES ends, Samsung investors will likely return their focus to chip prices and 5G smartphones. Write to Eric J.

Is Amazon (AMZN) at risk of a near-term earnings disappointment?Sentiment on the stock heading into its fourth-quarter financial results a few weeks from now is decidedly mixed. On the one hand, there’s general enthusiasm for 2020 and beyond as Amazon continues to show solid growth in both e-commerce and cloud computing. But the issues with Amazon always involve its willingness to spend up front for growth down the road—which is exactly what the company has been doing with its recent ramp-up of one-day shipping.This morning, BofA Global Research analyst Justin Post upped his price target on the stock to $2,330 from $2,160 while repeating his Buy rating. “Amazon has strong growth prospects in 2020 with improving delivery capabilities and still low cloud penetration,” Post writes in a research note. He adds that proprietary survey data finds strong “lock-in” for Prime members, with one-day shipping gaining traction.Post writes that his new target price reflects his valuation of Amazon Web Services at 8 times forward revenue, retail at 1.1 times gross merchandise value, and advertising at 6 times revenue. But Post notes that his 2020 forecast is for $329 billion in revenue and $45 billion of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), which is actually a little below Street consensus at $330 billion and $49 billion. His view is that investment in free one-day shipping and expansion of the retail grocery business “will be deeper than Street estimates.” Ergo, he sees some risk to Q1 guidance, but asserts that “investors will see the margin bottom,” and that the stock should start to gain momentum this spring.Adds Post: “Looking forward, we see Amazon as well positioned as both e-commerce and the Cloud remain early stage, and we anticipate Amazon to generate growth above the Internet sector over the next five years. Also, Amazon is one of the few companies in the sector with a positive margin growth outlook driven by an ongoing mix-shift to higher margin revenue.” J.P. Morgan’s Doug Anmuth today repeated his Overweight rating and $2,200 price target on the stock, which remains one of his best ideas for 2020. In a research note, he writes today that there has been some pressure on the stock over concerns about both margins and increased competition for AWS, pointing out that estimates came down in 2019 both for Amazon’s profits and for growth at AWS. Like Post, Anmuth thinks Amazon is well positioned for 2020, driven by expanded one-day delivery, less intense capital spending and AWS “benefitting from its recent sales and market investments.” Anmuth sees Q4 revenue of $85.9 billion, a tad below consensus, but at the high end of the $80 billion to $86.5 billion guidance range, “with potential upside…from a strong U.S. holiday season.” He says Q1 sales guidance could surprise to the upside but there could be downside to the current operating income consensus as margins moderate in the face of heavier spending.In a research note Monday. RBC Capital’s Mark Mahaney placed Amazon at the top of his list of internet stocks facing the most risk heading into Q4 results. He notes that analysts are anticipating first-quarter operating profit will be up from Q4 despite “five straight years of guiding down” sequential profit in the March quarter; he also worries that there could be “an aggressive reversion to investment mode” for both Amazon’s retail and AWS arms. Deutsche Bank’s Lloyd Walmsley observes in a research note Tuesday that there have been multiple recent executive changes at AWS, with a new sales and marketing lead, a new CMO and a new CFO. “We think the magnitude of personnel changes in senior leadership at AWS, on top of fundamental risks…from slower enterprise workload migrations to the cloud and increasing competition from Microsoft and Google, underscore increased risk of further deceleration at AWS,” he writes. Nonetheless, he maintains his Buy rating on the stock.Amazon stock was down 1.2% to $1,869.29 in recent trading. The stock, which gained about 23% in 2019, is up less than 2% for the year to date.

 Activision Blizzard stock is attractive at current levels due to its strong franchises, according to Instinet.Activision Blizzard shares (ticker: ATVI) rose 21% last year versus the S&P 500’s 31.5% total return. Its stock was volatile in 2019 due to uncertainty over the company’s title pipeline and the gaming console cycle.On Tuesday, Instinet analyst Andrew Marok reaffirmed his Buy rating for Activision Blizzard shares. He also raised his price target to $70 from $64 for the stock.“We think ATVI is well positioned over the medium term, with pipeline visibility and mobile opportunities providing runway for share price appreciation,” he wrote.Activision Blizzard shares were up 1.2% to $59.94 on Tuesday.The analyst expects the publisher will launch sequels to Overwatch next year and Diablo in 2022. He also is optimistic on the company’s prospects with the new console launches in 2020 and the rise of gaming streaming services. Both Sony and Microsoft have announced that their next generation consoles will be released later this year.“We think ATVI is likely to be unaffected at worst, and more likely than not to benefit, from key industry trends, including the introduction of new gaming consoles this holiday season and longer-term trends such as the transition to cloud gaming,” the analyst wrote. “Even with what we believe are conservative assumptions, we see a compelling case for share price appreciation,” he added.Last month, Barron’s suggested Activision Blizzard was a great way to play the new console cycle this year, citing the strong performance of its Call of Duty franchise and attractive pipeline.

 Apple shares pose a conundrum even for the most bullish investors. The stock has doubled in just over 12 months, and has followed last year’s 86% run by tacking on an 8% gain in the first eight trading days of 2020. As Barron’s has noted before, the stock has blown right past most Wall Street share-price targets. That has left analysts to decide whether to adjust their financial models and raise their targets, or back away from the stock and advise investors to take profits.Atlantic Equities opted for Plan B on Tuesday morning, reducing their rating on the shares to Underweight and saying that the stock has “overshot.” But in a flurry of other research notes, the bulls are simply getting more bullish. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri reiterated his Buy rating on the stock, lifting his Apple price target to $355, from $280. The shares were down 0.2%, to $316.31 at midday on Tuesday.Arcuri wrote in a research note that the stock’s outperformance reflects anticipation of a strong 5G upgrade cycle once the new phones are announced later this year. He expects Apple to sell 196 million iPhones in the fiscal year that ends in September, up 5% from fiscal 2019, with a jump to 208 million phones in 2021. That would be a 6% increase.Arcuri said that his firm’s most recent global survey of smartphone buyers found “stable to improving purchase intent for Apple in all regions except China.” Sentiment is improving in Japan, the U.K. and Germany, and is flat in the U.S., he reported.In his research note, Arcuri said there are three key questions for Apple investors.Can iPhones grow? Arcuri says yes, noting that the company is likely to introduce four models this year, including three 5G models.Can wearable products continue to achieve strong growth? Again, he says yes, predicting that the “attach rate” of iPhone users for both AirPods and Apple Watch will continue to rise.Can services continue to grow 15%-20% a year? A third yes from Arcuri. He said he sees “a huge untapped installed base of active iPhone users” who could sign up for Apple Music, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, or Apple News+. Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison is another optimist. He reiterated his Buy rating and $345 price target on Apple shares. Checks suggest that iPhone shipments could be up 10% or more in the calendar first quarter, driven by demand for both the iPhone 11 and the expected launch of the iPhone SE2, he said.Meanwhile, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has become one of Apple’s biggest cheerleaders, wrote that the company’s fundamentals support a run up for the stock to $400 a share. “Many investors are asking us: Is all the good news baked into shares after an historic upward move over the last year and into early this year?” he wrote. “The answer from our vantage point is a resounding NO.” He says the combination of a 5G-driven “supercycle” for iPhones and the Street’s re-rating of the company’s growing services business are a one-two punch that could drive the stock to $400 by year-end.Ives said checks indicate that unit sales of the iPhone 11 are robust heading into the March quarter. AirPods, meanwhile, maintain “jaw dropping” momentum, he wrote. He said a research trip to Asia left him with the view that the iPhone 11 has “discernible strength both in the U.S. and China.” Apple has the potential to reach a $2 trillion valuation by the end of 2021 driven by 5G and services, Ives said. He argued that the services business alone could be worth $500 billion to $650 billion as the company further monetizes its base of an estimated 925 million iPhone users worldwide. The current market capitalization is $1.38 trillion, up from about $1 trillion in mid September. Write to Eric J.

Altaba, a longtime holder of Alibaba Group Holding, has begun selling its remaining stake of five million shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant and expects to complete the sale of the entire holding in the coming days, according to a securities filing.Altaba, which adopted a plan of liquidation last year, sold a million shares of Alibaba (ticker: BABA) on Monday at $229 a share for proceeds of $229 million. Altaba, which is organized as a closed-end fund, plans to provide daily updates on its website. Altaba is taking advantage of gains in Alibaba stock, which has risen 35% since the end of September. The sale of its Alibaba stock could indicate that Altaba management, led by CEO Thomas McInerney, thinks this is a good time to unload the remaining stake. Altaba declined to comment on the sale. On Tuesday, however, shares of Alibaba shares were down 1.6%, at $226.76.Altaba stock was delisted from the Nasdaq in early October, when it filed a plan of liquidation in Delaware and the last sale was at $19.63. The shares have advanced since then in over-the-counter trading and changed hands on Monday around $21.50, according to one investor. There is no listed market or ticker symbol now for Altaba, which has said it plans to make an initial distribution to investors in the fourth quarter of this year. The most recent Altaba net asset value, for Sept. 30, was $23.08 a share. The current discount to net asset value reflects uncertainty about the timing liquidation payments and tax issues. Individual investors have found it difficult or impossible to sell their Altaba stock since the delisting, and brokerage firms often show no carrying value for Altaba on client statements. This has made some investors mistakenly think that Altaba is worthless. The current over-the-counter market in Altaba is dominated by institutions. Altaba is the former Yahoo!, which changed its name to Altaba in June 2017 after it sold its internet business to Verizon Communications (VZ). At the time, Altaba’s main asset was a 15% stake in Alibaba, some 384 million shares, which it obtained more than a decade earlier. Altaba has sold down that big stake and was left with five million shares when it moved to formally liquidate. The small stake was held for tax-planning purposes.

 Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger doesn’t expect Netflix to aggressively raise prices this year—and expects that will be good for its shares. Last year was a roller-coaster ride for Netflix (ticker: NFLX) shareholders. The stock was up as much as 44% for the year in early May, but fell hard in the summer when the company missed subscriber estimates. In recent months, it has rebounded off its low and closed up 21% for 2019.On Tuesday, Juenger reaffirmed his Outperform rating for Netflix stock. He has a $422 price target for the shares.“We think Netflix is unlikely to raise pricing in most of North America, Western Europe, or Latin America during calendar 2020,” he wrote. “That leads to a reasonably logical bullish theory on Netflix subs in 2020, especially 1H: this year won’t face the same price-related churn and gross demand suppression as last year.” The analyst said his firm tracked the pricing for Netflix subscriptions in more than 50 countries and found only one—Australia—in which the streaming company raised pricing last month. He added they found Netflix is testing discounted longer-term subscription plans from three to 12 months in India.Other Wall Street analysts are generally positive on Netflix. About 63% of them have ratings of Buy or the equivalent on the stock, while 26% have Hold ratings, according to FactSet.Earlier this month, Barron’s suggested Netflix may have a difficult time raising pricing over time due to the launches of new lower-priced streaming competitors such as Walt Disney’s (DIS) Disney+ and Apple’s (AAPL) Apple TV+.Netflix stock was down 0.8%, at $336.25, in recent trading.

Tesla’s stock rally is delighting the bulls, confounding the bears and amazing everyone else. Shares of the electric-vehicle pioneer cruised by the $500 Monday, gaining more than 9% to almost $525. It seems there is no stopping the rally. Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock is up more than 24% year to date and almost 110% over the past three months. Investors skeptical of Tesla’s stock-market valuation attribute the big gains to a short squeeze. That happens when bearish investors who had bet on a price decline by selling the stock short rush to cover their bets all at once, usually after good news, sending the stock higher. That is one explanation for the recent run. But there is another. The stock market might be behaving rationally regarding Tesla stock. Actual profit, not the hope for profit, catalyzed Tesla’s recent run. Things got rolling with better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. Tesla stock was about $250 a share before third-quarter numbers were released in late October. Now Wall Street is modeling higher profit for 2020. Since October, analysts have raised 2020 estimates from less than $4 a share to about $6.64 a share. That is a 66% rise in expected earnings. The stock has risen even faster, so Tesla’s price-to-earnings multiple has expanded. Tesla trades for about 72 times estimated 2020 earnings, far higher than the 18 to 19 times average earnings multiple for stocks in the S&P 500. Shares of auto maker General Motors (GM) trade for less than 6 times estimated 2020 earnings.Tesla will have to keep making money to maintain stock-price momentum. But at least there is a price-to-earnings ratio to measure. It wasn’t so long ago that the hope of profit trumped actual profit in the stock market. Uber Technologies (UBER), for instance, had a peak market value of about $80 billion last summer. At that time, Tesla’s market capitalization was about $40 billion. Uber was a hot-IPO with plans to disrupt traditional car ownership. Profit, however, isn’t on the horizon for Uber. Wall Street expects the ride-hailing giant to lose about $2.35 a share in 2020. Wall Street has soured on profitless companies since the summer, and Uber’s value has declined by almost 30%, while Tesla’s value has soared. Tesla bears, as a result of the rally, are surely frustrated. Still, the stock remains heavily shorted. At more than 25 million shares, that is more than 18% of Tesla stock available for trading and about eight or nine times more short selling than occurs on average for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock was up 2% Tuesday morning to $535.60, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.3%.Looking ahead, the big event for the company in 2020 will be the debut of the Model Y sport-utility vehicle. It is smaller than the Model X, which puts it in the sweet spot of vehicle size. Americans bought roughly eight million SUVs in 2019. The Toyota (TM) RAV-4, the Honda (HMC) CRV and the Nissan (NSANY) Rogue were the top-selling SUVs in the U.S.The similar-size Model Y, however, qualifies as a luxury car and is expected to compete against BMW (BMW.Germany), which sold about 70,000 X3 compact SUVs in the U.S. last year. The bulls eagerly await Model Y volumes. The bears continue to lick their wounds.

 Morgan Stanley believes investors need to be more selective in picking software stocks this year after the industry’s big rally in 2019.The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector exchange-traded fund (ticker: IGV) rose 34.3% last year versus the S&P 500’s 31.5% total return. “After a strong performance across software in 2019, full multiples and indications of a slowing software spending environment, investors likely need a finer filter to find the really compelling opportunities in the sector,” Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote on Monday. The analyst said most software valuation multiples based on enterprise value to sales “appear rich,” but select names on an enterprise value to free cash flow basis look more reasonable.Here are three Overweight-rated software companies that made the firm’s top software stock ideas list for 2020. Adobe (ADBE) Morgan Stanley has a $410 price target for Adobe stock.Adobe has “one of the strongest franchises in software, benefiting from the secular shift towards digital marketing,” the firm’s analyst wrote.The firm believes earnings estimates may go higher for the company in the future. Adobe shares were up 1.5% to $344.94 on Monday. Salesforce.com (CRM) The firm has a $216 price target for Salesforce.com shares.“With a cloud-based platform automating and optimizing all stages of the customer life cycle, Salesforce.com looks best positioned to benefit,” Morgan Stanley’s analyst wrote.Salesforce.com shares were up 2.1% to $183.99 on Monday. Microsoft (MSFT) Morgan Stanley has a $189 price target for Microsoft shares.“As the IT conversation shifts from pure Public Cloud towards hybrid Cloud architectures involving enterprises utilizing a mix of on-premise and public cloud resources, Microsoft pulls ahead as the best secularly positioned firm in tech,” he wrote.Microsoft shares were up 0.9% to $162.86 on Monday.

 J.P. Morgan’s Samik Chatterjee said Monday that iPhone shipment volume might not generate much upside, according to his analysis of Apple’s suppliers sales. Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) rose 86% last year as investors anticipated that its shift to services and the debut of 5G iPhones later this year will lead to increased profitability. On Oct. 30, the company reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter because of strong revenue from services and sales of wearable gear like AirPods.“Supplier revenue trends with relevance to iPhone global shipments and latest volume trends in the key China market imply limited upside on iPhone shipment forecasts,” he wrote. Apple shares were up 1.3% to $314.45 Monday afternoon. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.9%. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the J.P. Morgan report.The analyst noted that aggregate Apple supplier revenue fell for three months in row on year-over-year basis. The J.P. Morgan iPhone supplier tracker dropped 6% year-over-year in December after a 2% drop in November and 5% fall in October.Despite the supplier data, Chatterjee is optimistic that Apple’s services business can outperform and pick up the slack.“The increasing momentum of Services continues to point to the likelihood of acceleration in Services revenue growth, driving upside relative to investor expectations,” he wrote.Chatterjee has an Overweight rating and $296 price target for Apple shares.Other Wall Street analysts are generally optimistic on Apple. Fifty-eight percent have a Buy or Overweight rating on the company, according to FactSet. Only 14% have Sell ratings on the smartphone maker.

Seeing “5G tailwinds” for makers of mobile-phones, Citi analyst Atif Malik this afternoon raised his price targets on two companies.Malik raised the price target on Skyworks Solutions stock (ticker: SWKS) to $125 from $98, and raised the price target on Qorvo stock (QRVO) to $118 from $98. In both cases, he keeps Neutral ratings, citing concerns about both “long-term China substitution risk at Huawei and concentration risk at Apple (AAPL).” Malik says his move comes in response to a positive December quarter earnings announcement Monday from the London-based chip maker Dialog Semiconductor (DLGNF). Dialog Monday announced that revenue for its December quarter would be about $381 million, above the midpoint of its previous guidance range of $350 million to $390 million. Dialog makes mixed-signal chips for power management, Buetooth, backlighting, and various other applications for customers such as Apple, Xioami, Huawei Technologies, and Samsung. Malik writes that historically, fundamentals at mobile-chip makers like Skyworks and Qovo “correlate decently” with conditions at Dialog. In a note last month, Malik placed Skyworks on Citi’s “catalyst watch list,” anticipating that the stock would outperform over the next few months based on strong holiday sales, the expected Apple SE2 iPhone launch in the first quarter, last week’s CES conference in Las Vegas, and Mobile World Congress next month in Barcelona.Dialog stock rallied 5.2% to $54.80 on Monday. Skyworks stock surged 3.7% to $124.51. Qorvo stock rose 2.1% to $115.74. Write to Eric J.

 Tesla stock just crossed the $500 line, setting a new intraday high on Monday. An analyst at Oppenheimer thinks shares have even more room to run. The back story. Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) has turned around from its 2019 low of $176.99 to become the most valuable car company in America, in terms of market value. (How it actually compares to General Motors in 1955 is a different story.) Baird analyst Ben Kallo, once among Tesla’s biggest bulls, last week cut his rating to Hold and recommended taking profits in what he described as a “tactical move” that doesn’t change his faith in the stock in the long term.“While we remain constructive on [the company’s] long-term prospects, we now believe estimates are properly calibrated—particularly on the buy-side—and valuation appears more balanced,” Kallo wrote. What's new. Tesla stock kept pushing higher Monday morning, when it gained about 6.6% to $509.60 around noon, while the S&P 500 index was up 0.5%. The stock was on pace to close at record.And why stop there? Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch says the stock can rise even higher. He raised his price target to $612 from $385, an estimate that now captures the company’s “leading technology differentiation and incremental growth potential.” That marks the stock’s highest price target listed by Bloomberg, while some major firms have targets as low as $200.“While TSLA has stumbled through growing pains, we believe the company has reached critical scale sufficient to support sustainable positive [free cash flow],” he wrote. “At the same time, we believe the company’s risk tolerance, ability to implement learnings from past errors, and larger ambition than peers are beginning to pose an existential threat to transportation companies that are unable or unwilling to innovate at a faster pace.”He cited advantages in powertrain design, battery technology, its advanced driver assistance systems fleet, as well as plans for energy independence and consumer enthusiasm to drive gains, despite continued share volatility. Looking Ahead. Rusch has an Outperform rating with a $612 price target.“Given the resolution of manufacturing bottlenecks and demonstration of strong consumer demand, we believe TSLA is becoming a must-own stock and could benefit from inclusion in additional indexes,” he wrote.Tesla has a higher organizational tolerance for risk than its peers, he adds, and will see “accelerated learning cycles driven by that tolerance as the company matures.” Write to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.com~technology~Tesla~2020-01-13~The company poses “an existential threat to transportation companies that are unable or unwilling to innovate at a faster pace,” Oppenheimer says.~Tesla,TSLA,financial performance,analysts' comments,recommendations,share price movement,disruptions,corporate,industrial news,companies,technology,barron's take,transportation,us,motor vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive~Tesla Is an ‘Existential Threat’ to Car Companies That Can’t Innovate, Analyst Says~https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-500-record-51578941248?mod=hp_LEAD_1~2020
