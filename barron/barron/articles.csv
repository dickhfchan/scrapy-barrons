It looks like we have an early winner in the 5G chip wars. Qorvo (ticker: QRVO) shares surged in early trading Friday after the company reported fiscal second-quarter sales results and gave guidance for its current quarter above expectations. It posted revenue of $806.7 million for its September quarter, versus the $755 million consensus. The chip maker also forecast a revenue range of $840 million to $860 million for the December quarter, compared the $761 million average analyst estimate.Qorvo makes radio-frequency, or RF, semiconductors, which enable smartphones to communicate with wireless networks. Qorvo stock rose 18% to $95 on Friday, the day after its results.The better-than-expected financial results stand in contrast to recent worries by some analysts that Qovro would lose chip business with Huawei Technologies, which is on a U.S. export blacklist due to national-security concerns. But instead Qovro said it secured new design wins with a major Korean smartphone maker and with four Chinese phone makers. “Qorvo delivered another solid quarter, as our technology investments, portfolio management, and operational discipline continued to yield strong and consistent performance. We are especially pleased with 5G design activity and the trends we see toward increasing RF integration,” Qorvo CEO Bob Bruggeworth said in the earnings release. Piper Jaffray analyst Harsh Kumar reiterated his Overweight rating for Qorvo shares and raised his stock price target to $95 from $85.“Qorvo reported a very strong September quarter, significantly above Street expectations,” Kumar wrote Thursday. “The strength was driven by strong share gains for 5G solutions at Samsung as well as top Chinese OEMs.…We believe the company is executing well in the current environment.” Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.com~technology~Huawei Technologies~2019-11-01~Qorvo shares surged in early trading Friday after the company reported fiscal second-quarter sales results and gave guidance for its current quarter above expectations.~Huawei Technologies,02502.SZ,Qorvo,QRVO,asia,companies,earnings report,feature,technology,markets,morning movers,us,computers,consumer electronics,networking,digital cellular technology,electronic navigation,tracking systems,industrial electronics,industrial goods,radio frequency identification equipment,wireless area network technology~Qorvo Stock Soars as Wall Street Is Stunned Over Its 5G Chip Gains~https://www.barrons.com/articles/qorvo-stock-soars-as-wall-street-is-stunned-over-its-5g-chip-gains-51572620880?mod=hp_LEAD_1~2019
