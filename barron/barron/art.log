         'investors are more concerned about less grandiose issues like '
         'near-term profitability and what that says about the economy.So far, '
         'investors are preparing for somber news, confirmation that growth is '
         'slowing, when Cisco (ticker: CSCO) discloses its first-quarter '
         'earnings on Nov. 13. The company’s role as a barometer of business '
         'spending—if companies are doubtful about their own prospects for '
         'making money, they buy less from Cisco—has discouraged investors.Its '
         'customers are in the same boat as people deciding whether to upgrade '
         'their Apple (AAPL) iPhones or Microsoft (MSFT) computers, even as '
         'they worry they might lose their jobs.Analysts have mixed views. '
         'Goldman Sachs recently lowered Cisco’s investment rating to Neutral '
         'from Buy. BTIG told clients that Cisco was one of only 12 companies '
         'that have beaten forecasts for revenue and earnings per share over '
         'the past eight quarters. The options market is erring on the '
         'cautious side. For the past eight quarters, Cisco stock has moved '
         'about 5% in reaction to earnings day news, but this year the stock '
         'is only expected to move 3%, according to Goldman Sachs '
         'research.This difference between actual earnings-day moves, and the '
         'change implied by options prices might seem slight, but the spread '
         'is actually quite large by market standards. The difference between '
         'the two reinforces how blasé investors have become about a stock '
         'that is up only 9%, compared with about 20% for the S&P 500. Therein '
         'lies a trading opportunity.Cisco’s stock chart paints a portrait of '
         'a tortured journey for the shares and investors. Since early July, '
         'shares are down about 18%. Investors have repeatedly stepped in to '
         'buy at around $46, but the experience has been discouraging. Each '
         'time shares move up $1 or so to around $47, the little rally loses '
         'power and nothing much else seems to happen.This steadiness around '
         '$46 to $47 makes the pending earnings more interesting than is '
         'perhaps appreciated. Both the stock’s trading pattern and options '
         'pricing indicate that investors have effectively lined up wagers '
         'that will prove profitable if Cisco’s earnings report makes the '
         'stock rally higher. If that doesn’t happen, those investors trying '
         'to catch Cisco’s turn in the market may dump the shares, creating '
         'opportunities to use options to potentially profit from the '
         'outcome.With the stock around $47, investors can buy the November '
         '$46 put that expires Nov. 15 for 69 cents, as well as the November '
         '$48 call for $1.03. It also expires Nov. 15. The “strangle '
         'strategy”—buying a downside put and an upside call with a higher '
         'strike price but similar expiration—is often used to trade stocks '
         'that are likely to move sharply if it isn’t clear whether they will '
         'rise or fall. Should the stock rally, the upside calls are worth $4 '
         'if the shares are at $52 at expiration. If the stock falls on the '
         'earnings report, and is at $40 at expiration, the put is worth $6. '
         'The key risk, of course, is that the stock does nothing in reaction '
         'to the news. The money spent on this speculation would be '
         'lost.During the past 52 weeks, Cisco’s stock has traded from $40.25 '

         'around its Office 365 and Azure strategic vision based on our recent '
         'checks,” wrote Ives in a Tuesday research report. Azure is the name '
         'of Microsoft’s cloud-computing business. The Defense Department '
         'awarded a huge contract—worth up to $10 billion—to Microsoft on Oct. '
         '25. It was an upset. Amazon’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, or AWS, '
         'division was the favorite, according to Wall Street. The contract '
         'award sent shock waves through the industry, wrote J.P. Morgan '
         'analyst Mark Murphy. That’s because Amazon is the cloud giant. AWS '
         'reported about $26 billion in sales during 2018. Numbers for Azure '
         'are more difficult to obtain. Microsoft reports about $64 billion in '

         'Ives told Barron’s in an email. The “cloud” refers to moving '
         'applications and data storage off local hardware and onto the web, '
         'so both can be accessed and analyzed by any device connected to the '
         'internet. “We believe Redmond is poised to win the lion’s share of '

{'body': '   Beyond Meat is no longer one of short sellers’ favorite stocks to '
         'bet against—at least according to the numbers. Now on the medal '
         'podium for the most heavily shorted unicorns are other, newly public '
         'start-ups. Networked exercise company Peloton Interactive (PTON) and '
         'cloud companies Zoom Video Communications (ZM) and Fastly (FSLY) are '
         'now the three most heavily bet against unicorns—privately held '
         'businesses worth more than $1 billion—based on shares available to '
         'trade, according to Barron’s calculations.   Shorting a stock means '
         'investors borrow shares and then sell them—a bet that the shares '
         'will decline. Investors have short bets on about 14% of Beyond '
         'Meat’s shares (ticker: BYND) that are available for trading. That is '
         'down from more than 50% shortly after the alternative meat '
         'start-up’s initial public offering, or IPO. But that doesn’t mean '
         'short sellers have taken profits and gone home. In fact, all that '
         'has happened is more Beyond shares are available for trading, since '
         'many have come out of IPO “lock up.” That’s the 180-day period '
         'following an IPO when many insiders and founding investors are '
         'prohibited from selling stock. Short sellers are just about as '
         'bearish about alternative meat as they were before the lockup '
         'expiration. What the changing percentages do mean, however, is '
         'Beyond’s stock volatility might be tamped down. There is more share '
         'supply available when short sellers buy back stock in the market to '
         'cover bearish bets. It lessens the chance of a short squeeze—when '
         'bearish investors rush to cover a bet against a stock, but can’t '
         'find enough stock and end up paying very high prices to stem '
         'losses.The supply of stock might seem like an obscure nonissue '
         'but—in common New York parlance—it’s not for nothing. Beyond '
         'investors would surely cheer less volatility. Shares have dropped '
         'about 65% from their all-time high, even as the stock remains up '
         'about 100% from where it opened for trading. Volatility like that '
         'can cause even the most ardent vegan-meat supporters to question '
         'their investment. Less chance of a short squeeze is good for short '
         'sellers too, but ultimately that’s cold comfort for bearish '
         'investors. Even though short sellers profited last week when the '
         'stock dropped more than 20% after a surprisingly strong earnings '
         'report, they aren’t in the black yet. “We are seeing a reversal of '
         'fortunes as [Beyond’s] lockup expiry has triggered [a drop] in its '
         'stock price,” read a recent report from short selling data analytic '
         'provider S3 Partners. But short sellers were down about $1 billion '
         'in mark-to-market losses when Beyond hit its post-IPO high of about '
         '$234 a share in July. About half of those losses have been recouped '
         'since then, according to S3. Still, a $500 million loss is big. '
         'Overall, short sellers haven’t been impressed by the current 2019 '
         'crop of unicorn IPOs, including Beyond Meat. The average short '
         'interest—stock sold short compared with shares available for '
         'trading—is about 15% among unicorns. The market value-weighted '
         'average for the S&P 500 is about 2%. And the bearishness isn’t all '
         'due to IPO lockups. Short interest for unicorns is higher than '
         'average, no matter how investors choose to calculate bearishness.The '
         'best news for short sellers might be that bets against other '
         'unicorns have worked out. While the average gain for 2019 IPOs is '
         'about 8%, based on Barron’s calculations, the total amount of money '
         'lost by investors in 2019 IPOs actually tops $12 billion. How is '
         'that possible—to have a positive average gain and lose money? The '
         'average gain calculated is independent of company size. It is the '
         'largest IPOs which are the year’s worst performers. Uber '
         'Technologies (UBER), for instance, is down about 31% from its IPO '
         'price. Based on the data, it looks as if short sellers are still '
         'targeting unicorns for more declines. That means investors in '
         'Peloton Interactive, Zoom, and Fastly can expect more volatility in '
         'the future. Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com',

{'body': 'Here we are, barely more than a month into the fourth quarter, and '

         'ISI analyst Lee Horowitz raised doubts about the company’s ability '

         'data from the app download tracking firm Sensor Tower show global '
         'downloads of Netflix apps were up 2% year over year in October, as '
         'international growth slowed to 3% from 6% in September. '
         'Domestically, the story was a little better, with downloads off 4% '
         'in October, following a 10% drop in September, “as a growing film '
         'slate seems to have bolstered the top of the funnel '
         'domestically.”Adds Horowitz, “While we would caution against reading '
         'too deeply into these results, given a Q4 content slate which '
         'appears strongest later in the quarter, October levels are '
         'consistent with below-guidance Q4 subscriber results.”He adds that '
         'the coming Netflix release of the Martin Scorsese film The Irishman '
         'will benefit subscriber growth trends in November, but he adds that '
         '“a geographic analysis of download trends associated with ‘El '
         'Camino’ [the recent movie based on the popular series Breaking Bad] '
         'suggest that US dramatic films may not materially move the '
         'subscriber growth needle in key international growth markets.”The '

{'body': 'While the IPO market has temporarily ground to a halt, there are '
         'still opportunities for the intrepid investor to buy shares of hot '
         'companies like Airbnb, Snowflake Computing, and Impossible Foods '
         'that haven’t actually offered stock to the general public just yet. '
         'That’s what Forge does—arranges trades in pre-IPO shares. The San '
         'Francisco-based company is one of several players in this growing '
         'niche market, allowing longstanding insiders and venture investors '
         'to get out while creating a path for institutional and '
         'high-net-worth individual investors to bet on fast-growing privately '
         'held companies.The fact that Forge and rival SharesPost even exist '
         'reflects the dramatic changes that have unfolded in the past few '
         'years in initial public offerings. Companies are staying private '
         'longer—10 years or more from inception, in many cases—and often '
         'generating hundreds of millions in revenue before filing. That leads '
         'to higher market caps at IPO—many tech companies have been launching '
         'with valuations in the billions. Meanwhile, with most IPOs, insiders '
         'can’t trade on day one due to lockup restrictions, leading to stocks '
         'with big market caps but thin floats and wildly trading shares.That '
         'combination leads to frustration for both early investors, who can’t '
         'immediately sell shares, and for institutions who want to own the '
         'stocks but can’t get enough initially to establish meaningful '
         'positions.All of that helps explain the growing interest in Forge. '
         'There have been transactions in pre-IPO stocks for many years, but '
         'the friction has historically been high, requiring companies to sign '
         'off on any transactions in their shares, and with challenges in '
         'matching buyers and sellers in a way that allows for efficient price '
         'discovery. But as companies stay private longer, shareholders are '
         'pushing harder for an opportunity to sell shares—and institutions '
         'are eager to get involved in high-growth opportunities ahead of an '
         'initial offering.Forge Chief Executive Officer Kelly Rodriques says '
         'his company has arranged about $2 billion in trades over the past 18 '
         'months, working with most of the top 100 privately held '
         'venture-backed companies as ranked by valuation. He says Forge will '
         'do about $100 million in revenue in 2020. Rodriques says the volume '
         'of trading in privately held shares is growing at better than 100% a '
         'year. “Today you are seeing more company-structured liquidity '
         'programs for their employees, and you are also seeing more venture '
         'capital investors selling positions while companies are still '
         'private,” he said in a recent interview with Barron’s. “The '
         'traditional IPO ‘pop’ is now happening 18 months before companies '
         'actually become a public company.”Rodriques notes that there are '
         'about 50 private companies with a valuation north of $3.7 billion, '
         'many with no near-term plans to go public, and he counts close to '
         '500 pre-IPO companies with valuations above $1 billion, up from '
         'about 320 a year ago. He says demand for pre-IPO shares has not been '
         'slowed by recent stumbles in the IPO market, which has seen the '
         'postponement of IPOs by WeWork, Endeavor, Postmates, and '
         'others.“While trading activity surges ahead of almost all liquidity '
         'events, we’ve seen a consistent upward trend in trading volume '
         'across the entire year as more unicorns reach new average historic '
         'values,” he says. “Even if private innovation companies continue to '
         'extend their IPO timelines, we still predict that growth will remain '
         'stable next year.”Rodriques contends the supply of pre-IPO '
         'investment will grow in both breadth and depth—more shares of more '
         'companies. The CEO says he’s also seeing the emergence of structured '
         'products like baskets of privately held unicorn shares, opening the '
         'market to a broader set of investors.Rodriques think Forge can '
         'emerge as a substantial trading platform. He estimates there are '
         '1,000 private companies with valuations north of $400 million, with '
         'a combined value of $3 trillion. If there were 5% turnover in that '
         'base every year, he says, with transaction fees in the 2% range, '
         'there’s potential to create a company generating billions in '
         'revenue. (A little back of the envelope math leads to $3 billion in '
         'potential fees based on those parameters.) He says there was $50 '
         'billion in trading volume in the private market overall last year, '
         'and Forge is seeing just a fraction of that so far. He notes that '
         'many transactions are on an ad hoc, privately arranged basis. But '
         'Rodriques says Forge is trying to add some rigor to the market, and '
         'plans to roll out a data service that would report on trades to '
         'improve price discovery. So what’s hot right now in trading on '
         'Forge? Rodriques says investors are focusing on “business models '
         'that allow for a path to profitability, strong revenue growth and '
         'are viewed as category creators.” He says there’s interest in '
         '“non-capital-intensive marketplace models,” like Airbnb, and '
         'enterprise software companies with recurring revenue models, like '
         'Databricks, Digital Ocean and Snowflake. Says Rodriques: “Even if '
         'the IPO market slows down, the opportunity to generate strong '
         'returns from pre-IPO stock investments will remain steady and '
         'consistent.” Write to Eric J. Savitz at eric.savitz@barrons.com',

         'new $2.5 billion program from Apple, based in Cupertino, follows '
         'similar (but smaller) commitments from its corporate neighbors '
         'Google, in Mountain View, and Facebook, in Menlo Park. According to '
         'Zillow, the price of the average house in both Cupertino and Menlo '
         'Park tops $2 million, and Mountain View isn’t very far behind. Apple '
         'said its program is intended “to accelerate and expand new housing '
         'production; jump-start long-term developments that would otherwise '
         'not be possible; help first-time buyers purchase homes; and support '
         'new housing and programs to reduce homelessness.”The company said '
         'nearly 30,000 people left San Francisco between April and June of '
         'this year, and homeownership in the Bay Area is at a seven-year '
         'low.“As costs skyrocket for renters and potential home buyers—and as '
         'the availability of affordable housing fails to keep pace with the '

         'responders and service workers are increasingly having to make the '
         'difficult choice to leave behind the community they have long called '
         'home,” Apple said Monday morning.The program includes multiple '
         'parts:In June, Google unveiled a $1 billion program to support '
         'creation of 20,000 new homes, including repurposing “at least $750 '
         'million” of Google-owned land that had been zoned for office or '
         'commercial space for residential projects. Google said the land will '
         'allow the company to develop “at least 15,000 new homes at all '
         'income levels.” Google also pledged to create a $250 million fund to '
         'encourage developers to build at least 5,000 affordable housing '
         'units.And in October, Facebook announced a $1 billion plan to create '
         'up to 20,000 new housing units “to help essential workers such as '
         'teachers, nurses and first responders live closer to the communities '
         'that rely on them.” That includes $250 million for a partnership '
         'with the state of California for “mixed-income housing” on '
         'state-owned land; $150 million for production of affordable housing '
         'in the Bay Area; $225 million in land Facebook owns in Menlo Park; '

         'AAPL) can draw an audience for the new service in the long run, and '
         'whether it makes a difference for the company financially. Deutsche '
         'Bank analyst Jereiel Ong wrote in a new research note that “while '
         'the initial reviews have certainly been tepid at best,” he has a '
         'more optimistic take on the offering so far. And he also thinks that '
         'while the current slate might not be worth the price, it may not '
         'matter.“We don’t see the present content slate as worth $5/month in '
         'comparison to more robust, built-out content libraries of '
         'competitors, but such competition does not matter much, in our view, '
         'when upwards of 100 million-pluis iOS users (if the present free for '
         'a year promotion sustains into 2020) will have access to TV+ content '
         'free of charge for a year,” he writes. “Such a strategy gives TV+ a '
         'chance to improve its content library over time while maintaining '
         'access to potential future paying consumers. All-in, due to the '
         '‘free for a year’ strategy, coupled with how Apple’s content library '
         'will be different 6-12 months from now, we believe it is too early '
         'to forecast true paying subscribers several years out with any level '
         'of confidence.”The analyst thinks the service is better than the '
         'reviews portray, given that just a few episodes are available for '
         'the top shows, new episodes are added weekly (unlike on Netflix '
         '(NFLX)) and new programs are likely to be added each month.Ong says '
         'the service isn’t going to have a financial impact on Apple for now, '
         'given how aggressively the company is giving the service away. (It’s '
         'free to students, as well as to anyone who buys a new device.) “In '
         'our view, discussions about X million users x $5/month to build a '
         'revenue model are presently somewhat premature in light of this '
         'near-term dynamic,” he wrote. Longer term, the business could make a '
         'difference to the company “if it can gain leverage on its fixed cost '
         'content investments (which could have already added up to '
         'multi-billions of dollars by our estimates), but also to other '
         'competitors in the market who either already have their own '
         'streaming solutions or plan to launch a solution soon,” he said.The '
         'analyst also noted that investor sentiment was similarly bearish '
         'about the launches of both the Apple Watch and the AirPod. A common '
         'refrain was that the products wouldn’t make a difference to Apple '
         'given the company’s size. Yet Apple Watch and AirPods are now likely '
         'to account for 10%-13% of Apple’s revenue over the next two years, '
         'Ong noted. “We aren’t making a call that we are certain that TV+ '

{'body': 'When the world’s largest oil producer goes public, it will surely '
         'mean a new dynamic for all the players in the oil industry. Some oil '
         'stocks might get hit more than others.Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil '
         'producer Saudi Aramco finally started its long-planned initial '
         'public offering process on Sunday, after multiple delays and no lack '
         'of skeptical voices. By offering shares of the oil producer—for the '
         'first time since Aramco was nationalized in the 1970s—the kingdom '
         'hopes to use the funds raised to diversify its economy and get ready '
         'for the post-oil era. For the global oil industry, this is probably '
         'one of the most important events in recent history, just given the '
         'sheer size of the company. Saudi Aramco had originally hoped for a '
         '$2 trillion valuation. Now, as the deal moves along, people familiar '
         'with the matter said the valuation will likely fall below the '
         'target, given the compressed energy prices this year and '
         'geopolitical tension in the region. Even if that’s the case, Aramco '
         'would likely become the world’s largest company by market value, '
         'well above Apple (ticker: AAPL) at $1.2 trillion, Microsoft (MSFT) '
         'at $1.1 trillion, and Amazon.com (AMZN) at $887 billion. But the '
         'listing’s actual impact on other oil competitors might not be as '
         'significant as feared.To start with, the stock will be listed on '
         'Saudi’s Tadawul exchange rather than other western marketplaces, '
         'like New York or London. This could limit the interest from '
         'international investors that aren’t active in the Saudi market, '
         'unless there is a follow-on listing on other stock exchanges. '
         'Bernstein analyst Neil Beveridge says Aramco’s investor pool will be '
         'somewhat different from other major oil companies, appealing more to '
         'sovereign-wealth funds and strategic investors.Still, Aramco’s '
         'attractive dividend payout could draw investors away from other oil '
         'competitors with lower yields. Aramco management has committed to a '
         'minimum dividend of $75 billion a year, from 2020 to 2024. If valued '
         'at $2 trillion, the company will offer a yield of 3.75%. But if the '
         'valuation is cut down to $1 trillion, the yield will be doubled to '
         '7.5%--much higher than the peer group’s current average yield, '
         'around 6%. “Simply put, the higher the dividend yield of Aramco, the '
         'greater the possibility of rotation into Aramco from other oil '
         'majors and vice versa,” wrote Beveridge. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and '
         'Chevron (CVX) have among the lowest yields among western oil majors, '
         'but they also have a better growth outlook with the large shale oil '
         'deposits in the U.S. Emerging market oil majors with lower yields, '
         'such as PetroChina Co mpany (PTR) and Petróleo Brasileiro (PBR), '
         'might turn out to be most at risk, says Beveridge. But management in '
         'these companies might be encouraged to raise their payout ratios to '
         'stay competitive, depending on where Aramco ends up pricing. “Aramco '
         'could set a new benchmark for yield and payout among oil majors,” he '
         'wrote. And simply by joining the global indexes, the stock will have '
         'a dilutive impact on other stocks within the passive universe and '
         'draw a huge amount of assets from index-tracking funds. Beveridge '
         'estimates that Aramco is worth between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 '
         'trillion. If included in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, the '
         'company alone would equal about 10% of all the constituents’ '
         'aggregate market value. But don’t expect to Aramco actually to have '
         'an outsize representation in the MSCI EM index, since the weighting '
         'is based on free float rather than market cap. Aramco only plans to '
         'offer 2% of its shares for now. Assuming a $1.5 trillion valuation, '
         'the free float will only be around $30 billion. According to '
         'Beveridge’s estimates, the oil giant will likely account for around '
         '0.55% of the MSCI EM index. That’s not the top, but still marks one '
         'of the index’s 10 biggest constituents, behind Alibaba (BABA) and '
         'Tencent (0700.HK).For the same reason, the IPO’s impact on other '
         'major oil players’ index representation could be more limited than '
         'some expect. “Although Aramco will have a market cap equivalent to '
         'all other global oil majors combined, the free float is only 2.5% of '
         'the combined free float for global oil majors,” wrote Beveridge. “At '
         'this level, the dilution impact will be relatively small.”Oil '
         'companies in emerging markets—many controlled or fully owned by a '
         'national government—might turn out to be affected more, says '
         'Beveridge. Aramco’s free float of $30 billion will constitute about '
         '12% that for all the state-owned peers, according to his estimate, '
         'and that’s not insignificant. Write to Evie Liu at '

{'body': 'The Federal Reserve has given U.S. stocks a green light to keep '

         'U.S. stocks up more than 20% this year and valuations looking steep, '
         'equities are likely to keep rallying due to supportive Fed monetary '
         'policy, according to Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist '
         'at Invesco. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell “reassured us that the hurdle '
         'rate is high for any kind of rate hike,” she remarked at a '
         'conference sponsored by Charles Schwab in San Diego on Tuesday. '
         '“He’s essentially given stocks free range to run.” Market Data '
         'Center: EMEA and AsiaYet Hooper views emerging markets as better '
         'bargains. Valuations look elevated in the U.S., she noted. But '
         'emerging markets remain both cheap and attractive, and should '
         'benefit from looser monetary conditions and capital flows arising '
         'from the Fed’s rate cuts. In addition, markets like Thailand and '
         'Vietnam are getting a lift as U.S. companies seek to avoid U.S. '
         'tariffs on Chinese goods by shifting supply chains to other Asian '
         'countries. “The conventional wisdom was that because China was in a '
         'trade war, the entire region would suffer,” Hooper said. “But we’re '
         'seeing supply chain shifts regionally.” China’s economy can still '
         'grow at a healthy 5.8%-6% rate over the next year, she added. And '
         'the country is taking measures to offset a trade-related slowdown. '
         '“They’ve felt pain from trade wars, but they’re throwing stimulus at '
         'the economy and will throw more if they need to,” she said. Hooper '
         'doesn’t expect 2020 to be a smooth year for financial markets, '
         'however. The U.S.-China trade war may get a reprieve with a “phase '
         'one” deal coming soon, but “it’s not a done deal and is likely to be '
         'the only phase we see,” Hooper said.Economic protectionism is on the '
         'rise globally as income and wealth inequality increase. Bilateral '
         'trade deals, which appear to be the trend now, would create more '
         'economic friction that the large multinational deals of the past few '
         'decades. Confidence in the World Trade Organization has been '
         'degraded. And the global economy is seeing levels of protectionism '
         'that rival those in place during the Great Depression of the 1930s. '
         '“I’m worried about protectionism, and the stakes are higher today '
         'than a few decades ago,” Hooper said. The U.S. is in a better '
         'position than most countries because it’s largely a '
         'consumer-spending-driven economy, she noted. Europe and Asia are '
         'more oriented to exports and manufacturing and would be harder hit '
         'by rising trade frictions. “But we can experience spillover '
         'effects,” she added.While investors should stick with equities, '
         'Hooper recommends emphasizing low-volatility and income-oriented '
         'dividend stocks. These types of stocks have become hugely popular, '
         'pushing valuations up sharply, but Hooper doesn’t see them in bubble '
         'territory. “You can have stretched valuations and they can stretch '
         'further,” she said. “Don’t be afraid of U.S. equities in this '
         'environment.” Exchange-traded funds that focus on low volatility and '
         'emerging markets have done well this year, though they are trailing '

{'body': 'Tech companies need to spend enough money on research and '
         'development to keep the growth engine running. A failure to stick to '
         'that script may explain the issues now plaguing Twitter (ticker: '
         'TWTR).Evercore ISI analyst Kevin Rippey cut his rating Thursday '
         'morning on Twitter shares to Underperform from In Line, with a new '
         'price target of $25, down from $42. And his primary observation is '
         'that the company has underinvested in the business—and that they are '
         'going to pay the price at the bottom line going forward.In '
         'particular, the analyst asserts that the Street is far too '
         'optimistic about the company’s margins (and by extension, '
         'profitability) going forward. Rippey writes in a research note that '
         'Twitter’s third-quarter earnings “mark a stark reversal in what had '
         'been several years of stellar execution.” He notes that bugs linked '
         'to the rollout of a new ad product and other data-related issues '
         '“led to an abrupt revenue slowdown.” And he adds that forward '
         'guidance “suggests the issue will take at least another quarter to '
         'fix.” Twitter declined to comment.Twitter shares are down almost 30% '
         'from recent highs, but Rippey says the current share price '
         'nonetheless still represents “an unrealistic view of the path '
         'forward.”Rippey observes that Twitter bulls anticipate a return to '
         'the better than 15% GAAP operating income margins reached in the '
         'March 2018 fiscal year. But that year “represented a period of '
         'unsustainably high margins,” he says, as Twitter “reaped the '
         'benefits of a period of sustained underinvestment.” For Twitter to '
         'reach the level of revenue growth the Street consensus expects, he '
         'asserts, “the prerequisite will likely be ongoing growth in R&D '
         'spend at rates faster than those of revenue.”The Evercore analyst '
         'says the Street’s free cash flow forecasts are 10% too high for '
         'fiscal 2021 and 20% too high for FY 2022, “and appear increasingly '
         'overly aggressive from there.” Even at his newly reduced $25 target '
         'price, the stock would still trade at a premium to both Facebook '
         '(FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) on a cash-flow-multiple basis.Rippey '
         'describes the problems at Twitter as a “tech debt.” He notes that '
         'the company spent less in R&D over the last year than in 2013. Snap '
         '(SNAP) outspent Twitter over the last 12 months by 33% on half the '
         'revenue base, and Facebook and Google continue to grow their R&D '

{'body': 'Two words that investors dread sparked a sharp selloff in Chesapeake '
         'Energy stock this week. Shares are down 33% week to date. “Going '
         'concern” language clearly spooked the market, but investors familiar '
         'with the company know that most of the pain was felt long ago. '
         '“Going concern comments are not uncommon, particularly in the case '
         'of an excessively leveraged company,” accounting expert Robert '
         'Willens said. “That’s because going concern commentary and '
         'disclosure is required when it becomes more likely than not—or '
         'becomes probable—that an entity will be unable to meet its financial '
         'obligations within 24 months of the financial-statement date.” While '
         'accountants are required to put the notice in the filings, warnings '
         'about Chesapeake’s leverage aren’t news, per se—or shouldn’t be. '
         'Everyone knows that Chesapeake (ticker: CHK) is struggling under '
         'more than $9 billion in net debt. That is a lot compared with its '
         'market value of less than $2 billion. And shares—before the week’s '
         'brutal decline—were down more than 50% over the past year and about '
         '98% from their all time high. Think of it this way. Chesapeake '
         'shareholders lost about $1 billion this week. Since the stock’s '
         'all-time high, losses are in excess of $130 billion. Accountants—as '
         'with so much financial reporting—are telling investors what has '
         'already happened. Still, “going concern” spooked equity investors. '
         'Even bond investors got the jitters. Chesapeake bonds that Barron’s '
         'checked fell from about 67 cents on the dollar to 53 cents this '
         'week. The bonds yield more than 20%. At either price, however, it is '
         'clear the bond market doesn’t have a lot of faith in the future of '
         'Chesapeake as it is structured. The news isn’t all that bad for the '
         'sector, though. Low gas prices can bankrupt overly indebted '
         'companies, but the gas still exists. As long as it is moved and '
         'used, pipeline companies should get paid. What’s more, if Chesapeake '
         'files for bankruptcy protection, the company doesn’t go away, its '
         'financial obligations are restructured. Still, investors hate '
         'volatility. The Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) has trailed the S&P 500 by '
         'about 5 percentage points since Monday, when Chesapeake news started '
         'to roil the sector. It is hard to argue with the market. But over '
         'time energy prices and demand, and not Chesapeake’s woes, will '
         'determine the future of the sector. The next step in the financial '
         'filings would be to go from “going concern” to preparing financial '
         'statements on a “liquidation basis,” according to Willens. It would '
         'record its assets at liquidation value instead of historical cost, '
         'as other financial reports require. Liquidation value is the current '
         'sale price less cost to sell the assets. “Almost any company that '
         'files a petition in bankruptcy would warrant such disclosures and '
         'commentary,” Willens said. “For example, PG&E [PCG] is in that mode '
         'and has even received a going concern opinion from its auditors.” '

         'Cardinal Health (CAH), and AmerisourceBergen (ABC), all opioid '
         'defendants, were each up after reporting solid earnings.Teva turned '
         'in earnings per share of $0.58 for the quarter, one cent short of '
         'the S&P Capital IQ Consensus estimate of $0.59. Revenues were $4.3 '
         'billion, slightly above the $4.2 billion Wall Street estimate.Teva '
         'said it has set aside approximately $1 billion to provide for future '
         'opioid settlements. The company put aside approximately half of that '
         'in the second quarter of this year, and the other half in the third '
         'quarter, following the tentative agreement reached with the '
         'attorneys general.“We very much hope that the framework agreement '
         'will come to fruition,” Schultz said. “We believe it’s the only '
         'really constructive way to move forward in the opioid '
         'litigation.”Yet even if the opioid clouds clear, plenty more are on '
         'the horizon for Teva. The company faces both a federal investigation '
         'and a civil suit brought by state attorneys general over allegations '
         'that it and other companies engaged in price fixing of generic '
         'drugs, a claim the company denies.Schultz said that the company had '
         'turned over a million documents to federal investigators. “We have '
         'not found any evidence in all those documents that we in any way '
         'whatsoever participated in organized collusion or price fixing,” he '
         'said.Still, Schultz said that he expects the price-fixing issue to '
         'linger. “I think it will take quite a while,” he said.The stakes for '
         'Teva as it addresses the lawsuits against it have long been '
         'heightened by the company’s extraordinarily large debt load. The '
         'company said that its net debt amounted to 5.6 times its earnings '
         'before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization in the third '
         'quarter of the fiscal year. The comparable figure for the S&P 500 '
         'was 1.8 as of September.Much of Teva’s debt is coming due in the '
         'near term, including more than $4 billion in 2021. Still, Teva bond '
         'prices have held relatively steady, particularly in comparison to '
         'some of the steep drops seen for the debt of other generic '
         'drugmakers.“We paid down more than $8 billion in debt in the last '
         'two years,” Schultz said, predicting that finding lenders to '
         'refinance upcoming maturities will not be a challenge. “We have a '
         'very open communication about everything; we have a very strong '
         'generic business” and good cash flow generation, he said.Analysts '
         'were generally positive after the earnings release on Thursday, '
         'matching the upbeat tone of the markets. “Despite the EPS miss, '
         'management appears to be executing as planned to close out the year, '
         'and as such we believe the stock could be up slightly on today’s '
         'results,” wrote SVB Leerink analyst Ami Fadia. Piper Jaffray’s David '
         'Amsellem wrote there were “some positives,” but that “there’s still '
         'that elephant in the room.”“We remain cautious on the shares given '
         'what in our view is murky visibility into management’s ability to '
         'significantly chip away at its debt levels,” Amsellem wrote, citing '
         'the question marks remaining around the opioid settlement.For '
         'Schultz, the framework deal on the table is the best hope, though he '
         'still disputes the notion that his company has responsibility for '
         'the opioid crisis.“Conceptually I don’t feel that the real '
         'underlying reason for people suffering from addiction can be '
         'subscribed to activities of Teva,” he said. “Nevertheless, I’m happy '
         'to contribute to improving the situation. But I don’t really see the '
         'straight link between our actions, and our compliance with all rules '
         'and regulations, and then having responsibility [for] the crisis.” '

{'body': 'The U.S. and China have agreed to suspend some of the existing '
         'tariffs on each other’s goods in phases if an initial trade deal is '
         'reached, a move that could give stock markets a near-term lift. But '
         'it remains unclear if a deal will be reached—and even more uncertain '
         'that a phased deal will remove the broader trade uncertainty that '
         'has complicated global companies’ investment plans. The iShares MSCI '
         'China ETF (ticker: MCHI) rose 1.3%, to $61.49 in late-morning trade, '
         'while the S&P 500 was up 0.58% at 3094.56.A spokesman for China’s '
         'Ministry of Commerce said both sides were moving closer to an '
         'initial phased trade agreement, but stressed that such a pact was '
         'conditioned on both sides removing “the same amount” of tariffs '
         'simultaneously. Removing tariffs has been an important demand for '
         'the Chinese in a trade deal, while creating an enforcement mechanism '
         'has been a key demand for the U.S. “ China is highly protectionist '
         'when it comes to data, requiring all foreign companies to store data '
         'in local servers if they want China exposure. ” The impact of the '
         'tariffs since 2018 and uncertainty around trade was expected to '
         'shave 0.8% off the global economy by the end of 2020, according to '
         'the International Monetary Fund’s estimates at its meeting last '
         'month. IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath had estimated that if '
         'tariffs for October, which were suspended last month, and the '
         'still-looming December tariffs were put on hold, the hit would fall '
         'to 0.6%.Markets have been moving on optimism the two sides will '
         'reach an initial phased trade deal—largely seen as a truce rather '
         'than a comprehensive agreement. And that optimism is likely to '
         'continue over the next month and half as efforts to strike a deal '
         'before the next round of tariffs, set for Dec. 15. But TS Lombard '
         'China policy analyst Eleanor Olcott said she believes there could be '
         'more bad trade war news between now and the 2020 election. Rolling '
         'back tariffs “could open up President Donald Trump to criticism from '
         'opponents that he was soft on China, potentially raising the '
         'possibility he raises tariffs at a later stage,” says Olcott, adding '
         'that it is “almost inevitable” negotiations will unravel again. And '
         'that means the uncertainty damping corporate spending and investment '
         'will continue, especially as the initial trade agreement focuses '
         'largely on agricultural purchases, a limited currency pact, and '
         'opening up China’s financial-services sector. These are moves that '
         'have largely been discussed earlier in the year and don’t tackle the '
         'bigger issues troubling companies operating in China, including '
         'state subsidies, forced technology transfers, and protections around '
         '“21st century” intellectual property, including data. As it stands, '
         'Olcott sees the initial phased deal on the table as more of a truce, '
         'with cross-border data flows likely to be a key stumbling block to '
         'more comprehensive agreements. “China is highly protectionist when '
         'it comes to data, requiring all foreign companies to store data in '
         'local servers if they want China exposure. This is a hugely '
         'sensitive issue in Washington at the moment and tied up with '
         'concerns over ‘national security,’ ” Olcott says. “The more the US '
         'is failing in its diplomatic campaign to freeze Huawei out of its '
         'allied partners’ networks, the greater the incentive to press China '
         'over tech through bilateral negotiations, and thus the less likely '
         'we will see long-term resolution to the economic conflict.” Huawei '
         'Technologies is one of the biggest producers of smartphones and '
         'telecommunications network equipment in the world, but in May '
         'President Donald Trump signed an executive order that put the '

{'body': ' Walt Disney management has had a lot to juggle lately: Integrating '
         'an enormous acquisition, launching a streaming service, and keeping '
         'its movie, TV, and theme park businesses firing all at once. It has '
         'given investors plenty to process as well. Disney is an even larger '

         'underpinning its performance.The company reports its fiscal '
         'fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday after the market closes. '
         'Investors will be looking for updates on the launch of the Disney+ '
         'streaming service, set to go live on Nov. 12, as well as the '
         'performance of its core businesses and newly acquired 21st Century '
         'Fox assets.Disney stock (ticker: DIS) had returned 21% this year '
         'including dividends through Tuesday’s close. That is behind the S&P '
         '500’s 25% return, but ahead of the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s '
         '20% return. It’s also well ahead of the stocks of Disney’s media '
         'competitors. Discovery (DISCA) shares had returned 13%, while '
         'soon-to-be-merged Viacom (VIAB) and CBS (CBS) stocks had lost 13% '
         'and 11%, respectively, after dividends this year.Here’s a snapshot '
         'of Wall Street’s expectations and some recent history.• Disney has '
         'been utterly dominant at the box office in recent years with hit '
         'after tentpole hit from its Marvel, Star Wars, and namesake '
         'franchises. Its theme parks have also seen a renaissance, as Disney '
         'opened new worlds and raised prices. Disney’s TV networks, '
         'however—which include ABC and ESPN—have faced an exodus of viewers '
         'as consumers cut the cord en masse in favor of streaming services '
         'from the likes of Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Prime '
         'Video.• In a response to that pressure, Disney made a $81.2 billion '
         'move to buy the majority of 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA) entertainment '
         'assets. That deal, which closed in late March, paired Fox’s TV '
         'networks and film studios, including National Geographic and FX, '
         'with Disney’s ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and other media '
         'properties. It also gave the House of Mouse a majority stake in '
         'Hulu, the streaming service. 21st Century Fox and Barron’s parent '
         'company, News Corp (NWSA), share common ownership.• Amassing all '
         'that content is meant to give Disney the resources to build out its '
         'own direct-to-consumer streaming offering and take on Netflix at its '
         'own game. At an investor day in April, Disney set ambitious targets '
         'for subscriber growth, the content on its services, and expected '
         'time to profitability. The three-pronged strategy includes Disney+ '
         'for family and children’s programming, ESPN+ for sports, and Hulu, '
         'which Disney describes as targeting adult viewers.• Disney’s first '
         'quarter with the former Fox assets was a flop. The company’s fiscal '
         'third-quarter results, reported on Aug. 6, fell short of '
         'expectations for both earnings and revenue, sending its stock down '
         'nearly 5% the following day. The biggest shortfall to estimates came '
         'from poor performance at the newly incorporated TV networks, film '
         'studios, and international brands that Disney acquired from 21st '
         'Century Fox in late March. Adjusted earnings were $1.35 per share, '
         'while analysts expected $1.72. Sales came in at $20.2 billion, below '
         'the $21.4 billion that the Street had penciled in.• Streaming '
         'investments are forecast to weigh on Disney’s bottom line in its '
         'fiscal fourth quarter. The company is expected to report 95 cents in '
         'adjusted earnings per share, down from $1.48 in the same quarter in '
         '2018. Revenue is estimated to come in at $19 billion, versus $14 '
         'billion last year.• Disney will release its results after the market '
         'closes on Thursday, followed by a conference call with analysts at '
         '4:30 p.m.• Disney+ is set to launch in the U.S. on Nov. 12 at a cost '
         'of $6.99 a month or $69.99 annually, about half the cost of Netflix. '
         'It will include new and library titles from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, '

{'body': 'Few investors are likely aware of Gates Industrial, but it offered '
         'some fresh hope this week for the U.S. industrial economy. '
         'Improvement in industrial demand would be a welcome sign for all '
         'investors. Even though the U.S. consumer and overall consumer '
         'spending are more important for the stock market, industrial '
         'companies still matter—a lot—so investors should pay attention to '
         'industrial earnings reports. The industrial economy has been '
         'shrinking. U.S. stocks are still moving higher partly because '
         'consumers keep spending. Many of them, though, work for industrial '
         'businesses. No one wants to see industrial weakness turn into a '
         'consumer problem. Key U.S. manufacturing indexes have come in below '
         '50—indicating contraction—for three months. What’s more, German and '
         'Chinese manufacturing activity is down this year. In fact, '
         'industrial companies have been talking about slowing demand and '
         'trade-war headwinds for more than a year. That span, however, is '
         'about how long industrial downturns typically last. Wall Street '
         'realizes that and analysts are looking for signs of an upturn. Enter '
         'Gates Industrial (ticker: GTES). “While still facing challenging end '
         'markets in [the third quarter], Sector Perform-rated Gates saw '
         'pockets of stabilization in the quarter,” RBC analyst Deane Dray '
         'wrote in a Wednesday research report. Sector perform is the '
         'equivalent of Hold. Dray’s price target for Gates’ stock is $13. '
         'Gates reported earnings after the close of trading Tuesday and '
         'shares jumped almost 8% on Wednesday. The company is a pure '
         '“short-cycle” industrial, according to Dray. That means Gates sells '
         'a lot of relatively low-price parts that go into much larger, '
         'more-expensive capital equipment. For Gates, that is a lot of belts '
         'and hoses for cars and heavy machinery. Wall Street always tracks '
         '“short-cycle” companies to help call inflections in demand. “Auto '
         'destocking appears to be showing sign of stabilization,” Citigroup '
         'analyst Andrew Kaplowitz said of Gates quarterly performance, in a '
         'Wednesday research report. “Although industrial destocking is still '
         'seeking a bottom as headwinds from end markets including '
         'agriculture, construction and general industrial weighed on '
         'results—sales in each down greater than 10%.” Destocking refers to '
         'inventory reduction at Gates customers. Purchasing managers won’t '
         'reorder stock when they see end market demand falling. Even though '
         'some end markets haven’t turned, Kaplowitz recommends buying shares '
         'now. He as a Buy rating and a $14 price target for shares. It isn’t '
         'all good news for industrial investors. Raymond James analyst Sam '
         'Darkatsh downgraded another short-cycle industrial Thursday morning. '
         'The analyst cut his rating on MSC Industrial Direct (MSM)—a '
         'distributor of cutting tools and other products—to Sell from the '
         'equivalent of Hold. He doesn’t have a target price for shares. '
         'Darkatsh just doesn’t see the economic environment improving. '
         '“There’s simply too much evidence of end market deterioration,” he '
         'wrote in a Thursday research report. He points out that metal '
         'working activity indexes—like the broader industrial data—are '
         'falling. The conflicting views shouldn’t alarm investors. It isn’t '
         'uncommon for analysts to disagree at the bottom or the top of '
         'business cycles. After all, calling inflections is hard. Some wait '
         'for evidence and others go out on a limb. Strategists can offer a '
         'different perspective than traditional analysts. Stifel’s head of '
         'institutional strategy, Barry Bannister, doesn’t cover individual '
         'stocks, but helps clients adjust portfolio positioning. He thinks '
         'industrial stocks are poised to outperform. “We made the call '
         'October 13 that events were de-risking for the S&P 500 Cyclicals,” '
         'Bannister wrote in a Monday research report. Federal reserve help in '
         'the short term borrowing repo market, trade detente with China and '
         'some Brexit movement are three positives he cited in his report. He '
         'think cyclical stocks—including the industrial sector—can outperform '
         'the rest of the market for the next six to eight months. That’s long '
         'enough for investors to consider making changes to portfolio '
         'weighting.Gates shares were up 1.2% to $12.18 Thursday morning. MSC '
         'was down 0.6% to $75.87. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up '

{'body': 'It may be time for aggressive investors to consider ethanol. '
         'Production, inventories and trade policy might align to give the '
         'stocks a boost.Ethanol maker Green Plains (ticker: GPRE) reported '
         'earnings Tuesday evening and the stock jumped Wednesday, closing up '
         '11.6% to $14.65 a share. Things are looking up for the confusing, '
         'embattled commodity. “As expected, our third quarter results were '
         'attributable to a continued weak ethanol margin environment that '
         'began to show improvement in late September,” CEO Todd Becker said '
         'in the company’s Tuesday evening news release. Green Plains lost '
         'money in the third quarter. But Becker’s comment about the future '
         'boosted shares. Things were better in September. What’s more, Becker '
         'said on the company’s Thursday conference call that the industry was '
         'exhibiting “production discipline” and product inventories are the '
         'lowest in years.Low production and low inventory is a good setup for '
         'higher commodity prices. It sounds as if ethanol-producer profit '
         'margins are poised to move higher.If only it were that simple. '
         'Less-aggressive investors should be warned. Ethanol is confusing and '
         'not many people can claim to have traded the sector successfully. '
         'Four publicly traded ethanol companies that investors can '
         'watch—Green Plains, Pacific Ethanol (PEIX), Andersons (ANDE) and REX '
         'American Resources (REX)—are off about 67% from all time highs. The '
         'market value of the quartet is less than $2 billion, a fraction of '
         'the gasoline-refining industry they sell into. Ethanol-producer '
         'stock positions need to be watched carefully. The confusion comes '
         'from all the moving parts that go into the margins. Investors have '
         'to track corn prices, gasoline prices and ethanol inventories to get '
         'a sense of what companies should be earning. Corn is the main cost '
         'input for U.S.-based ethanol, so corn costs impact profitability. '
         'But ethanol prices don’t always track corn prices, because ethanol '
         'is sold as a gasoline replacement. There are complicating '
         'factors—such as regulation—but low energy prices push down ethanol '
         'prices. And ethanol, of course, is its own commodity. If producers '
         'make too much, prices fall. But when inventories are low—as they are '
         'now—prices can rise. All that still isn’t enough to predict ethanol '
         'profitability. Sugar matters, too. Brazil produces a lot of '
         'ethanol—just like the U.S.—and its industry is based on sugar. '
         'Low-price ethanol made from low-priced sugar can impact U.S. '
         'producer profits.The refining industry has historically hated the '
         'ethanol industry. Ethanol demand was created—in large part—by the '
         'U.S. government. First it was to replace the fuel additive MTBE, '
         'which was linked to water pollution. Later, George W. Bush-era '
         'federal renewable fuels standards sought to wean America off foreign '
         'oil by putting corn in the gas tank. Refiners don’t want to buy '
         'ethanol from third-party producers if they don’t have to. That also '
         'can make life difficult for the publicly traded ethanol companies. '
         '“Things are looking better for ethanol these days,” IAG agricultural '
         'consultant Mark Feight said. He noted the low inventories and said '
         'trade detente with China could boost U.S. ethanol exports, further '
         'tightening domestic supply and demand. “Then what the industry needs '
         'is sugar prices to rise to 15 cents, then the industry could do '
         'really well.” Global sugar prices are about 12.5 cents a pound. Why '
         'are sugar prices too low Barron’s asked? “There’s too much of it,” '
         'Feight responded. It’s a perfect answer coming from a commodity '
         'trader. Big supply drives down prices. There is a lot to consider. '
         'But if Becker is right and low inventories lead to better profits, '
         'ethanol stock prices should move higher. Green Plains shares are up '
         'about 14% year to date—most of the gain coming Wednesday—still '
         'trailing the comparable 20% gain of the Dow Jones Industrial '

{'body': 'Private equity is a heaven-sent investment, and if you don’t believe '
         'it, just ask the promoters. Or consult the CFA Institute or talk to '
         'the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers. '
         'Everybody likes private equity. Well, almost everybody. Dan '
         'Rasmussen wants nothing to do with it, and neither, at these prices '
         'and on these terms, does your columnist. You yourself may not hold '
         'an opinion on the subject. The business of investing in closely held '
         'firms has long been the specialized province of the likes of Bain '
         'Capital and KKR. But private equity for the masses could be only one '
         'regulatory rethink away. And if, as The Wall Street Journal reported '
         'this past week, the Securities and Exchange Commission opens the '
         'private-equity investment gates to everyday, “nonqualified” '
         'investors, you could have the chance to partake of what used to be '
         'called the “leveraged buyout” business. The stock market may be '
         'efficient, but emulation is the way of the world. Take a good idea. '
         'Drive it into the ground like a tomato stake. Boom: It’s a bad idea. '
         'Private equity was one such good idea. You borrowed the money with '
         'which to buy a nice, stable public company. You didn’t overpay. You '
         'leveraged the balance sheet, but you didn’t overleverage (well, you '
         'usually didn’t). You fixed up the operations, extracted fees, and '
         'paid yourself a cheerful dividend. When the time was right, you '
         'sold. In the prototypical 1982 buyout of Gibson Greetings, former '
         'Treasury Secretary William E. Simon personally turned $330,000 into '
         'more than $70 million. It took him and Ray Chambers, his partner, '
         'just 16 months. That transformational feat attracted all of the '
         'attention you’d expect that it would. Thus did a leap in the dark '
         'become a $3 trillion institutional asset class. Simon and Chambers '
         'borrowed at high interest rates, but low rates are the ones that set '
         'private equity to booming. University endowments and state and local '
         'pension funds are starved for investment income. The post-2008 bull '
         'market has boosted the value of their assets, all right, but it has '
         'likewise lifted the cost of their liabilities. In fact, the costs '
         'are expanding faster than the assets. Government bonds deliver only '
         '2%, but the funds require—the managers assume they will earn—upward '
         'of 7%. How to close this wide and widening gap? “We need private '
         'equity, we need more of it, and we need it now,” declared Ben Meng, '
         'chief investment officer of Calpers, in March. Certainly, Calpers '
         'needed private equity—from 1980 to 2006, notes Dan Rasmussen, '
         'founder and portfolio manager of Verdad Advisers, private equity '
         'outperformed the S&P 500 index by 6% a year, net of fees. It has '
         'been another story post-crisis. Citing data from Cambridge '
         'Associates and Oxford University, Rasmussen points out that, in the '
         'past 13 years, private equity has not beaten the public stock '
         'market, but either matched it or slightly lagged behind it—as you’d '
         'think it would almost have to. Since when do extraordinary returns '
         'not fall victim to enterprising emulators? Nonetheless, says '
         'Rasmussen, a longtime private-equity critic who (among other things) '
         'conducts his own soundings of professional investor sentiment, '
         'portfolio managers continue to expect private equity to generate the '
         'superior returns it’s not now earning. He calls the ruling bullish '
         'consensus “the greatest correlated belief of institutional and '
         'intelligent investors probably in the last 25 years.” Why do smart '
         'people fall for it? Perhaps, Rasmussen speculates, because they '
         'don’t understand the true sources of private-equity returns. “Size '
         'is No. 1,” he says. “The average private-equity deal is $180 million '
         'of equity. The large end of the micro-cap index is $400 million. So '
         'these are microcap transactions generally [after he spoke came '
         'reports that Walgreens Boots Alliance was weighing a plan to go '
         'private—no microcap, Walgreens]. “Second is leverage. The average '
         'private equity deal is 65% leveraged on a '
         'net-debt-to-enterprise-value basis, versus 10% for the Russell '
         '2000—so massively more debt. “Third is valuation. From 1980 to 2006, '
         'private equity was buying assets on average about seven times '
         'earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or '
         'Ebitda, at a time when the S&P was trading at 11. So you could go '
         'into private markets, buy assets cheap, and, if they got big or if '
         'you merged them with other things, you could sell them at higher '
         'valuations. Or you could sell them to public companies that would '
         'find that acquisition accretive.“Today and since 2006,” Rasmussen '
         'proceeds, “that gap has closed. Today, the S&P trades at 11 to 12 '
         'times Ebitda, and private equity at 11 to 12 times adjusted '
         'Ebitda.”If, as seems likely, those “adjustments” serve no purpose '
         'other than cosmetic ones, “private equity is paying higher prices '
         'than what public equities trade at, certainly nonindexed microcaps, '
         'which are at a discount to the S&P 500.“Private equity worked for a '
         'very long time,” he goes on, “primarily because they were buying '
         'cheap things with leverage and rolled them into the market that was '
         'trading at a significant premium. As money has flooded in, starting '
         'when private equity became an asset class in 2006-07, and really '
         'since the crisis, you’ve seen a diminishing of those relative '
         'returns driven in large part by the increase in valuations.” “More '
         'debt is no cure for a debt crisis,” nonbelievers in quantitative '
         'easing and ultralow borrowing costs used to repeat, but the debt '
         'cure has had legs, if not efficacy. Nowadays, Wall Street is '
         'advising the corporate sponsors of underfunded pension plans to '
         '“make low interest rates work for them,” as the Financial Times put '
         'it the other day, by borrowing to buy the earning assets they need '
         'to meet their contractual obligations. “Leverage is like chocolate '
         'cake,” Ted Forstmann, an LBO pioneer in the Simon and Chambers era, '
         'liked to say. He meant that a little goes a long way. But the '
         'temptation to overborrow is hard to resist when the cost is as low '
         'as it is, and the terms and conditions as slack as they are. Citing '
         'a study by Moody’s Investors Service, Rasmussen notes that the vast '
         'majority of the rated portion of private-equity cohort is denoted '
         'single-B or below, meaning deeply speculative grade. High '
         'expectations, lots of leverage, plenty of competition (among both '
         'promoters and investors), rich valuations, and, of course, scant '
         'liquidity—put it all together and you have what posterity might '
         'judge to be the very asset class you should have stayed away from. '
         'As for the “nonqualified” ordinary individual investor who may soon '
         'be pitched a private-equity investment, the word is “no.” Keep your '
         'cash by your side until the putatively qualified smart money flees '
         'the scene of a future financial accident. Bad times make for good '
         'opportunities. James Grant is founder and editor of Grant’s Interest '

{'body': 'Compared with the unicorn stocks backed by Silicon Valley’s '
         'technology hustlers, the new hot stocks are dull—so dull that you '
         'can find them in the portfolios of conservative investors who are '
         'mostly focused on safe investments.With dividend yields that exceed '
         'those of many bonds—and demonstrable earnings power—these stocks are '
         'increasingly appealing to institutional investors as the Federal '
         'Reserve keeps lowering interest rates. Many money managers must be '
         'invested all of the time, and many regularly get monthly inflows of '
         'new cash. But it is difficult to feel good about being fully '
         'invested as the stock market keeps dancing around record highs. '
         'Concerns are rising once more that the rally is largely paced by a '
         'few big names, such as Apple (ticker: AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN). '
         'The timing is perfect for dividend stocks to become popular. Some '
         'are even attracting the type of trading interest in the options '
         'market usually reserved for hot tech stocks. On Monday, for '
         'instance, when AT&T stock (T) was up a penny—even as the broad '
         'market rallied—investors made some bold moves that are rarely '
         'associated with a stock that pays hefty dividends. AT&T has an '
         'annual common stock dividend of $2.04, representing a yield of 5.2%, '
         'which dwarfs the 1.83% yield of the 10-Year Treasury. When its stock '
         'was recently around $38, one investor bought 68,000 January $41 call '
         'options. Another investor bought 12,000 November $39 calls and sold '
         '12,000 January $41 calls to create a “bull spread” that pays off if '
         'the stock breaks above $41.16 at expiration. (Calls increase in '
         'value when the underlying security price increases.) The trades were '
         'notable for their size, and because big trades made in anticipation '
         'of advances are usually associated with momentum stocks. Rarely does '
         'someone buy calls on AT&T that represent a wager on the equivalent '
         'of 1.2 million shares of stock, much less 6.8 million shares. (One '
         'options contract represents 100 shares of stock.)The trades suggest '
         'that investors are wagering that AT&T’s stock will break into a new, '
         'higher trading range by January and set a new 52-week high. Over the '
         'past year, the stock has ranged from $26.80 to $39.50. Both trades '
         'anticipate that the stock, already up 37.5% this year, will trade '
         'well above $41. If the stock is at $46 at expiration—a huge move '
         'that could be possible if investors mob into the dividend stocks—the '
         '$41 call is worth $5. Of course, if the stock is below $41 at that '
         'time, these trades fail.It’s likely not a coincidence that the big '
         'trades occurred on the same day that Goldman Sachs was advising '
         'clients that investors were likely too pessimistic about the ability '
         'of companies to raise dividends.The bank’s chief U.S. equity '
         'strategist, David Kostin, wrote in a research note that the dividend '
         'swap market was pricing an average annual dividend-yield growth rate '
         'of 2.7% through 2023. Kostin expects the S&P 500 index’s per-share '
         'dividend will grow by 7% in 2019, 6% in 2020, and an average 5% '
         'through 2023. “Dividend growth pessimism is also evident in the '
         'valuation of high dividend yield stocks, which are trading at an '
         'extreme discount to stocks with low dividend yields,” Kostin wrote. '
         'In these situations, options often enable investors to elegantly '
         'bridge the divide. By buying calls, or even selling puts, investors '
         'can pre-position ahead of anticipated shifts in the stock market and '
         'investor sentiment. (Puts increase in value when the underlying '
         'security price declines.) Unlike stocks, options don’t entitle '
         'investors to receive dividends. Options do, however, enable '
         'investors to define risks, limit outlays, and profit from shifts in '
         'the financial markets. What will happen in the future is a matter of '
         'opinion, but a dividend is much more of a fact. Thus it is likely '
         'that this newfound affection for these conservative stocks will '
         'become increasingly prevalent—and even unicorn stock hustlers can '
         'appreciate that. Email: editors@barrons.com ',

{'body': 'That sound you might be hearing is the air seeping out of the bond '
         'bubble. It hasn’t been a big bursting, which is why it may have '
         'escaped your attention. If you were unlucky enough to have bought '
         'when the bubble was fully inflated late last summer, however, you '
         'may be suffering in relative silence. The most dramatic example has '
         'been the infamous Austria 100-year bonds, which this column first '
         'highlighted in late June and which Jim Grant deftly dissected with '
         'the a look back at history, and again with an examination of some '
         'bond mathematics. The Austria bonds in question are the 2.1% coupon '
         'ones maturing on Sept. 20, 2117, which were originally issued a '
         'little over a couple of years ago at just below par. Last June, a '
         'second tranche was issued at the princely premium of 154.047 euros '
         '($171) per €100 face value, which produced a yield to maturity of '
         '1.171%. To lock in such a low yield for so long, given the long and '
         'varied history of Austria over the past century, including '
         'annexation by Nazi Germany, provoked eye rolls. Only by comparison '
         'with the negative interest rates offered elsewhere—which, by '
         'definition, guarantee a loss if held to maturity—could locking in '
         'such a low yield be defensible.Except, of course, if the yield fell '
         'even further. As explained here, negative-yielding bonds could be '
         'profitable if their yields plumb still further into negative '
         'territory. Given the ineluctable math of bonds, falling yields mean '
         'the bond’s price rises. And the longer the bond’s duration—the '
         'sensitivity of a bond’s price to change in its yields, which '
         'primarily is a function of the length of time until its maturity—the '
         'bigger the price pop. By late August, the Austria “century” bond hit '
         'a price of 210 as the total amount of negative-yielding global bonds '
         'hit a peak of $17 trillion. Austria’s bond at that price provided a '
         'yield of 0.61%, at least with a positive sign. All of which made '
         'Austria’s century bonds the “poster child of the bond bubble,” '
         'writes Julian Brigden, chief economist at MI2 Partners. That bubble '
         'has been deflating, although not bursting, in recent weeks. By '
         'Wednesday, the bonds were down to a price of about 168, which '
         'results in a yield of just over 1%. That valuation still seems '
         'bubblicious; a 1% yield on a bond is analogous to a stock with a '
         'price/earnings multiple of 100. With a high P/E stock, you’re '
         'betting on big growth down the road. A bond returns only face value '
         'at maturity, assuming it’s paid off as promised.The drop in '
         'Austria’s century bond’s price to 168 from 210 still qualifies as a '
         'bona fide bear-market decline of 20%. Brigden’s price target is for '
         'a further fall, to 143.50. Such price swings typically are '
         'associated with tech stocks, not stodgy government bonds.None of the '
         'negative bond yields (still totaling $12.8 trillion) would be '
         'possible without European Central Bank policies, Brigden points out. '
         '“The ECB brought European yields down by two policies; quantitative '
         'easing (a pseudo fiscal policy) and negative rates (punishing thrift '
         'to boost asset prices).” Those policies may be reaching their '
         'limits, however.Not only is the ECB close to running out of bonds to '
         'buy, in the case of German and Dutch debt, he writes, but other '
         'European monetary authorities are beginning to question the '
         'usefulness of negative policy rates, notably Sweden’s Riksbank. An '
         'article published earlier this year by the Federal Reserve Bank of '
         'San Francisco also questioned the effectiveness of the Bank of '
         'Japan’s negative interest rates.The reversal in the Austrian bonds '
         'has been part of the backup of long-term European government bond '
         'yields. The benchmark 10-year German Bund yield has moved up to '
         'minus 0.33% from minus 0.70% in early September. The U.S. bond '
         'market hasn’t been immune to these moves. The benchmark 10-year '
         'Treasury note yield has moved up to 1.82% from 1.46% over that same '
         'span. In price terms, the popular iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond '
         'exchange-traded fund (ticker: TLT) is down 7.3% from its '
         'peak—roughly equivalent to a 2,000-point drop in the Dow Jones '
         'Industrial Average. And that’s even as the Fed lowered its '
         'federal-funds rate target range by a total of one-half percentage '
         'point in two steps over that span, to 1.50%-1.75%.The message is '
         'that Mr. Market has been selling ultralong, ultra-low-yielding bonds '
         'as recession fears fade. The effect is being felt in less extreme '
         'examples than Austria’s century bonds. It may not be such a bad '
         'thing if money flows back into stocks, which are at record highs but '
         'with valuations that aren’t beyond the bounds of historical norms. '

         'all three was—or is—going through significant turmoil. Two have '
         'benefited from celebrity help. The third might need the same. Papa '
         'John’s stock (ticker: PZZA) closed up 6.9%, to $61.14, on Wednesday '
         'after the company reported stronger sales in the third quarter than '
         'Wall Street was expecting. That brings the stock’s year-to-date '
         'gains to about 53%, far better than the comparable gain of the S&P '
         '500. Things weren’t looking so good in the summer of 2018 after '
         'reports surfaced that Schattner had used racial slurs. The company '
         'was already dealing with fallout from his comments about NFL '
         'players’ national-anthem kneeling protests. As the crisis grew, the '
         'stock dropped from a high of about $90 to less than $40. Enter Shaq. '
         'He joined the board of directors in March 2019, and since his '
         'appointment, the stock is up more than 20%. Papa John’s '
         'comparable-store sales grew 1% in the U.S. in the third quarter. '
         'That might not sound like much, but it’s better than the 10% drop in '
         'same-store sales in the third quarter of 2018 amid the Schnatter '
         'controversy. Having a new face in the boardroom—and on company '
         'commercials—has helped to stem the tide of negative PR. It’s likely '
         'Oprah Winfrey isn’t feeling as happy as Shaq Wednesday. The media '
         'icon owns more than 5 million shares of WW International (WW). '
         'Losses today amount to almost $30 million on that position after WWI '
         'stock plunged almost 15% in the wake of its third-quarter numbers. '
         'The quarter wasn’t that bad: The diet-program company beat Wall '
         'Street earnings expectations. “But its results failed to deliver the '
         'degree of acceleration that the market was expecting,” wrote UBS '
         'analyst Michael Lasser. He rates shares the equivalent of a Hold and '
         'has a $38 price target for the stock. Winfrey isn’t hurting, though. '
         'She bought in at around $8 a share in 2015, and her stake approached '
         'a value of about $500 million in 2018 before dropping to about $160 '
         'million Wednesday. WWI shares closed Wednesday down 14.8%, to '
         '$31.95. It’s tough to call Winfrey’s involvement a failure. After '
         'all, WWI’s sales declines stopped after she joined its board of '
         'directors, and sales growth at the company is still positive. Shares '
         'are up since 2015, but the company still has a lot of debt, raising '
         'the chances its stock will be volatile. Both companies seem to have '
         'benefited from board-level celebrity involvement. Then there’s Under '
         'Armour (UAA). Stock in the sports apparel maker is down almost 14% '
         'week to date after The Wall Street Journal revealed the company is '
         'involved in a yearslong accounting probe by the Justice Department. '
         'The alleged problems happened under CEO and founder Kevin Plank, and '
         'if the company is found to have knowingly produced misleading '
         'numbers, he could be exiled like Schattner was. Under Armour told '
         'Barron’s in an emailed statement that it believes its accounting is '
         'proper. Perhaps a sports celebrity could be persuaded to join the '
         'Under Armour board to help with PR and marketing. Plank was slated '
         'to retire as CEO anyway—and is still set to be the “brand chief” '
         'while remaining board chairman. In the early phase of any '
         'turnaround, as Papa John’s demonstrates, investors want stability. '
         'The important metric in that situation was comparable-store sales. '
         'Something similar, like sales growth in footwear or sales growth in '
         'overseas markets, would be the comparable metric for Under Armour '
         'stockholders. The company’s footwear sales decreased 12% in the '
         'third quarter. Amid turmoil, management or board-level shake-ups can '
         'be opportunities for investors. Under Armour stock is down about 67% '
         'from its all-time high. WWI and Papa John’s shares too were '
         'dropping. Now that pair is up about 700% and 56% from their '
         'precelebrity lows, respectively. Then a little further down the '
         'road, as WWI indicates, the story becomes the fundamentals, not the '
         'turnaround. Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com',

         'tightening lending standards in the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer’s '
         'Survey. All three typically would point toward a recession. Darda '
         'isn’t there yet. But he is watching first-time jobless claims for '
         'confirmation that a recession is in the offing. “If claims can hold '
         'at low levels through at least next summer, there will be a more '
         'persuasive case that the U.S. indeed dodged the recession bullet,” '
         'he writes. “It is a rise of more than 13.5% for the quarterly '
         'average of claims from year earlier levels, or more than 20% from '

         'Tuesday after the company missed earnings and sales forecasts, and '
         'listed its “ability to continue as a going concern” among the risks '
         'facing it. But somehow, Wednesday has been even worse for the '
         'shares. Chesapeake stock dropped 29% to 91 cents on Wednesday, an '
         'all-time low. Chesapeake’s shares were downgraded to Sell from Hold '
         'at Tudor Pickering, but that doesn’t seem to be the reason for the '
         'decline. Instead, it seems that reality is setting in. See, '
         'Chesapeake has a monster amount of debt—some $8.37 billion in net '
         'debt, according to Bloomberg. That debt comes with rules, known as '
         'covenants, that can limit Chesapeake’s actions if its debt grows too '
         'large relative to certain financial metrics. In this case, it is '
         'earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or '
         'Ebitda. “CHK’s credit facility contains a leverage covenant that '
         'begins at 5.5x for allowable leverage, and ramps down quarter '
         'beginning in 4Q19 by 25 basis points each quarter. On a total asset '
         'basis, we estimate that the company could brush up against this '
         'covenant in 3Q20 with our estimated net debt to LTM EBITDA of ~4.5x '
         'in 3Q20 vs. covenant restriction of 4.5x, after which we forecast '
         'the company to be out of compliance with the covenant,” writes '
         'SunTrust analyst Neal Dingmann. “We believe the company will explore '
         'all options for asset monetization and additional strategies for '
         'leverage reduction given the ongoing concerns with debt levels, '
         'difficult high-yield markets, and decreasing covenant '
         'restrictions.”Chesapeake’s bad news has carried over to master '
         'limited partnerships, i.e. the pipeline companies who carry its oil, '
         'writes Mizuho’s Paul Sankey, who listed “scary new language from '

         'Smith and Zack Van Everen point to Crestwood Equity Partners (CEQP) '

{'body': ' Election Day 2019 has passed, which means it is time for investors '
         'to look ahead to Election Day 2020. Last night’s results have some '
         'worrying about a potential Democratic surge—and what that might mean '
         'for the market. The results of Tuesday’s election don’t look great '
         'for Republicans. Democrats seized both chambers of Virginia’s '
         'legislature, and put the party in control of the state’s legislative '
         'and executive branches. And in Kentucky, a Democratic challenger '
         'appeared to have won a narrow victory over a Republican incumbent, '
         'though one who has been described as unpopular. With the election '
         'still a year away, anything can happen, especially because there is '
         'no clear front-runner among a field of Democrats looking to unseat '
         'President Donald Trump. Uncertainty has left markets in a holding '
         'pattern before, though nonelection factors often take precedence, '
         'which would explain the fact that the Dow Jones Industrial Average '
         'has gained 18% so far this year.A team of analysts and strategists '
         'at Morgan Stanley looked at potential scenarios, and here’s what '
         'they found:If Republicans can hold the White House and Senate, large '
         'cap banks, consumer finance, telecom, U.S. energy, and asset '
         'managers could see upside, while the dollar could face negative '
         'pressure.But on a macroeconomic level, a divided government would be '
         'less likely to counteract the current late-stage economic condition, '
         'Morgan Stanley says. “Divided government outcomes tend toward '
         'legislative gridlock,” they write. “And though divided governments '
         'could still influence the outlook through regulatory '
         'reinterpretations and resulting impacts to business sentiment, they '
         'are unlikely to deliver transformative policy in a macro sense. '
         'Hence, divided government is unlikely to deliver policy that '
         'counteracts the current late-cycle economic condition.”A blue wave, '
         'with Democrats in charge of the White House, Senate, and House of '
         'Representatives, has the potential to put positive pressure on U.S. '
         'GDP, the U.S. dollar, large managed care organizations, and non-U.S. '
         'gas and renewable energy, Morgan Stanley finds. It would be bad for '
         'U.S. Treasuries, pharmaceuticals, large cap banks, consumer finance, '
         'information technology hardware, U.S. internet companies, telecom, '
         'U.S. oil and gas, and asset managers.They cited proposed legislation '
         'and regulatory changes that are popular among Democratic candidates, '
         'like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders’ push for health care '
         'reform, environmental regulations, and higher taxes on the wealthy, '
         'noting many of the Democratic proposals would affect the most '
         'change.But a united government, either Republican or Democrat, could '
         'be good news because it means policy will be moving in one '
         'direction. “A policy of net stimulus, even with tax increases, can '
         'be a directional positive for growth, depending on its composition,” '
         'they write. “Hence, markets may reflect a reflation theme over time '
         'if a larger margin of victory for either side becomes more likely, '
         'though the sectors that would benefit most will differ based on the '
         'winning party.”They added that the outlook for trade policy and '
         'fiscal policy would matter the most to fundamentals, while corporate '
         'confidence and risk appetite could be hurt by “growing concerns of '
         'an aggressive regulatory agenda.” “Given this mix of variables, a '
         'unified government outcome could deliver meaningful policy change, '
         'but the impact to the overall direction of the index is less '
         'reliable this far out,” they wrote. “This syncs with what history '

{'body': ' CenturyLink stock just got hit with a new Sell rating ahead of its '
         'third-quarter earnings report. After discouraging reports from the '
         'wireline divisions of Verizon Communications and AT&T in recent '
         'weeks, the read-through to CenturyLink doesn’t appear promising, '
         'according to one analyst.CenturyLink stock (ticker: CTL) was down '
         '3.1% Wednesday morning, versus a 0.2% drop in the S&P 500 index. The '
         'back story. CenturyLink stock (ticker: CTL) is the worst-performing '
         'major telecom stock in 2019, losing 3.7% after dividends through '
         'Tuesday’s close. The stocks of cable operators Altice USA (ATUS) and '
         'Charter Communications (CHTR) have soared 90% and 66%, respectively, '
         'while wireless players AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) have returned 46% '
         'and 10%, including dividends, this year. The S&P 500’s year-to-date '
         'return was 25% through Tuesday.Since its bottom in late May, though, '
         'CenturyLink has outperformed them all, returning nearly 50%. '
         'Investors have been willing to take a chance on the company despite '
         'a dividend cut, shaky earnings, an executive departure and pressures '
         'impacting the wireline industry. CenturyLink has been working to '
         'invest in its business and some analysts called the selloff '
         'overdone. What’s new. On Wednesday, Guggenheim analyst Mike '
         'McCormack warned that CenturyLink’s recovery may now be the thing '
         'that is overdone. He dropped his rating on the stock to Sell, from '
         'Neutral, while maintaining a $10 price target—about 27% below the '
         'stock’s $13.65 closing price on Tuesday. McCormack had previously '
         'downgraded CenturyLink to Sell in January, then up to Neutral in '
         'May.In his latest downgrade, he cited contracting margins at the '
         'wireline divisions of Verizon and AT&T, which reported their '
         'third-quarter results on Oct. 25 and Oct. 28, respectively. '
         'Verizon’s wireline margins contracted 3 percentage points from a '
         'year earlier, while AT&T’s shrank by 1.6 percentage points. '
         'CenturyLink is essentially a pure-play version of those '
         'units.CenturyLink and other legacy wireline players have worked to '
         'maintain margins despite shrinking revenues in their high-fixed-cost '
         'businesses by aggressively cutting operating costs. McCormack noted '
         'that roughly two-thirds of Verizon’s 5,000-employee '
         'voluntary-separation program came in the wireline segment. Now he is '
         'worried that strategy might have reached its limit. “The margin '
         'pressures for both AT&T and Verizon in Wireline cause us significant '
         'concern for pure-play CenturyLink,” McCormack wrote. “While we are '
         'not attempting to make a call on the [third-quarter] print, we '
         'wonder if the dreaded negative operating leverage is starting to '
         'materialize…In our view, the ability to outrun margin pressure with '
         'cost cutting may be nearing an end for the industry, with revenue '
         'the only viable lever to grow out of the issue.”McCormack notes that '
         'CenturyLink may still have more cost-cutting levers to pull, given '
         'its current form as the merger of several smaller companies, and the '
         'potential for additional redundancies to be taken out. Looking '
         'ahead. McCormack said he could also imagine another dividend cut at '
         'CenturyLink, because of what he sees as better potential uses for '
         'the cash flow. The company announced on Feb. 13 it would slash its '
         'dividend by more than half, sending shares down more than 13% the '
         'following day.“We continue to believe that management is not likely '
         'wedded to the dividend, with it largely being a relic from legacy '
         'CenturyLink management, and does not align with the longer-term '
         'goals of today’s management,” McCormack wrote. “Although the payout '
         'ratio isn’t alarming, we have a hard time believing that the over $1 '
         'billion annual payment wouldn’t be more appropriately applied to the '
         'nearly $35 billion of debt, investment in the Business segment, and '
         'targeted Consumer fiber deployments to better position the '
         'company.”CenturyLink stock’s current dividend payout represents a '
         'yield of 7.3%.CenturyLink is scheduled to release its third-quarter '
         'results after the market closes on Wednesday, followed by a '
         'conference call with analysts at 5 p.m. The company is expected to '
         'report 33 cents in adjusted earnings per share, up from 30 cents a '
         'year earlier. Revenue is estimated to come in at $5.5 billion, '

         '2019 through Tuesday’s close as the fast-food chain has delivered a '
         'string of better-than-expected earnings despite intensifying '

         'number of analysts downgraded the stock from buy to neutral over the '
         'risks and uncertainty involved in providing breakfast, which has '

{'body': 'Warren, here’s your elephant.There was a report on Reuters Tuesday '

         'chain, is considering whether to go private in what would be the '
         'largest leveraged buyout ever. Its shares rose $1.56, or 2.6%, to '
         '$61.21 on the news. There are obvious impediments to such a '
         'transaction, notably the amount of debt that would needed to finance '
         'a deal for Walgreens, which has a market value of $55 billion and '
         'about $16 billion of net debt. It’s now valued at about 10 times '
         'annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and '
         'amortization (Ebitda). Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has '
         'been searching in vain for a large acquisition—what he has called an '
         'elephant—that could absorb a chunk of Berkshire’s (BRKA) growing '
         'cash balance, which hit a record $128 billion at the end of the '
         'third quarter. Walgreens is Buffett’s kind of company. It’s an '
         'easy-to-understand business that has an inexpensive valuation, '
         'trading at just 10 times projected earnings of $5.94 a share in the '
         'fiscal year ending in August 2020, a discount to the overall '
         'market’s price/earnings multiple of around 18. Berkshire could offer '
         'to pay $75 to $80 a share for Walgreens, or about $70 billion, in an '
         'all cash-deal or some mix of cash and Berkshire stock.At such a '
         'price, the deal would be accretive to Berkshire, given the low yield '
         'the Omaha, Neb.–based company is now earning on its cash and '
         'equivalents, which are largely held in Treasury bills. At $70 '
         'billion, Berkshire could earn a 7%-plus return on its investment in '
         'Walgreens. Buffett, 89, is sensitive to prices, and has complained '
         'that an influx of money from private-equity firms has driven up the '
         'cost of corporate acquisitions.“In the years ahead, we hope to move '
         'much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire will '
         'permanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not '
         'good: Prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term '
         'prospects,” Buffett wrote in the Berkshire annual shareholder letter '

{'body': 'Ray Dalio—founder of the world’s largest hedge fund—is sounding the '
         'alarm about the state of the global economy. In a blog post titled '
         '“The World Has Gone Mad and the System Is Broken,” he argues that '
         'zero interest rates, low returns, and growing economic inequality '
         'are setting the world up for something bad. Just what bad is still '
         'anyone’s guess.Dalio is known as a someone who thinks outside of the '
         'box. Take the firm he founded: Westport, Conn.–based Bridgewater '
         'Associates. The firm practices “radical truth and radical '
         'transparency,” requiring employees to be open to criticism as well '
         'as able to air their own, differing views. His YouTube video “How '
         'The Economic Machine Works” has been viewed more than 10 million '
         'times. “Money is free for those who are creditworthy because the '
         'investors who are giving it to them are willing to get back less '
         'than they give,” wrote Dalio in a Tuesday blog post on Microsoft’s '
         '(ticker: MSFT) LinkedIn. It’s a reference to the current situation '
         'where interest rates are negative in many places around the globe. '
         'It’s an unprecedented phenomenon, where investors are willing to '
         'lose money on a bond bought instead of just putting the cash under '
         'the mattress. (If only there was a mattress large enough for the '
         'trillions people want to store.) Zero interest rates are creating a '
         '“pushing on a string” dynamic, according to Dalio. Each attempt by '
         'global economic authorities to stimulate a moribund economy requires '
         'more and more money to less and less effect. “As a result of this '
         'dynamic, the prices of financial assets have gone way up and the '
         'future expected returns have gone way down while economic growth and '
         'inflation remain sluggish.”Every asset class is affected by '
         'excessive credit creation: stocks, bonds, and even venture capital, '
         'he says. “There is now so much money wanting to buy these dreams '
         'that in some cases venture capital investors are pushing money onto '
         'startups that don’t want more money because they already have more '
         'than enough,” wrote Dalio. Now comes the rub. Government deficits '
         'are huge, and growing. As deficits grow, the specter of higher '
         'interest rates looms. As governments seek to attract buyers for the '
         'mountains of debt needed to refinance their liabilities in coming '
         'years, Dalio sees upward pressure on interest rates. But higher '
         'rates “would be devastating for markets and economics because the '
         'world is so leveraged long.” That is a fancy way of saying there is '
         'a lot of debt in the system. Higher rates means interest costs to '
         'finance debt go up, pressuring consumer budgets as well as '
         'governments. When government budgets get squeezed, it means public '
         'services could get cut. Of course, global authorities aren’t going '
         'to give up and concede they were wrong. Dalio sees more central-bank '
         'bond buying and money printing. “This will exacerbate the wealth gap '
         'battle,” wrote Dalio. “The trickle-down process of having money at '
         'the top trickle down to workers and others by improving their '
         'earnings and creditworthiness is not working, the system of making '
         'capitalism work well for most people is broken.” It’s a dour '
         'assessment of the state of affairs. Dalio believes the situation is '
         'unsustainable and a “paradigm shift” is coming. The problem is that '
         'he doesn’t go on to describe the coming paradigm. Maybe how to solve '
         'all the problems of a heavily indebted, interconnected global '
         'economy will be the subject of coming missives. Write to Al Root at '

         'in a move that has lifted the company’s market valuation by $450 '

         'the end of 2018, and tacking on the current value of International '
         'Business Machines (IBM), plus SAP (SAP), plus Salesforce.com (CRM), '
         'and having room to spare. And this is for a company with '
         'low-single-digit growth that has been reporting declining sales of '
         'its flagship product, the mighty iPhone. Apple (AAPL) is making a '
         'bold but risky push to expand into highly competitive services '
         'markets like credit cards, online gaming and video streaming. So can '
         'the stock keep going?Yes, it can, says Wamsi Mohan, who follows the '
         'company for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mohan wrote in a research '
         'note that an analysis of past iPhone sales cycles suggests there is '
         'still “significant room for upside.” He looked at the performance of '
         'Apple shares relative to the S&P 500 from one iPhone launch to the '
         'next. Apple shares lagged behind the market heading into the launch '
         'of the iPhone 11, he found. Mohan says low expectations for the new '
         'phone dragged on the stock, just as they did before the launches of '
         'both the iPhone 5C/5S and the iPhone 7 launch. In each case, the '
         'following sales cycles “drove significant outperformance.” His '
         'conclusion: We should see the same kind of behavior in Apple shares '
         'headed into the expected launch of 5G phones next fall.“In cycles '
         'with positive returns, Apple shares have gained on average 47% on an '
         'absolute basis heading into product launches and 32% on a relative '
         'basis,” he writes. “In cycles with negative returns, Apple shares '
         'have declined on average 11% on an absolute basis heading into '
         'product launches and 20% on a relative basis. Given that we just '
         'completed a negative return cycle and are heading into launch of a '
         '5G phone we expect that the risk reward remains favorable despite '
         'the year-to-date performance.”Mohan maintained a Buy rating and $270 '

         'two-hour presentation to investors, founder and CEO Masayoshi Son '
         'said it was the first time in SoftBank’s history that it had '
         'reported a quarterly loss of that magnitude. The large loss '
         'primarily reflects the huge write-down in its WeWork and Uber stakes '
         'in the SoftBank Vision Fund, which suffered a loss in the quarter of '
         '$605 billion yen ($5.5 billion). Results, Son conceded early in the '
         'presentation, were “not good at all.”SoftBank took an $8.2 billion '
         'write-down of its WeWork stake, $4.7 billion of that at the SoftBank '
         'Group level, and $3.5 billion in the Vision Fund. SoftBank now '
         'estimates the value of WeWork, once believed to be $47 billion, at '
         'just $7.8 billion. In a recent effort to rescue WeWork, SoftBank '
         'pledged to provide WeWork with another $9.5 billion in a combination '
         'of debt and equity, a transaction that gives SoftBank a majority of '
         'the property company’s equity.In the quarter, the fund also saw the '
         'value of its position in Uber reduced by $3.5 billion. SoftBank says '
         'the carrying value of the 88 investments currently in the fund is '
         '$77.6 million, about 10% above total cost of $70.7 billion.SoftBank '
         'continues to seek funding commitments for a planned $108 billion '
         'Vision Fund 2, although the trouble with the first fund has many '
         'observers convinced that Son might struggle to meet his goals for '
         'the second fund.SoftBank stock fell about 3% in recent trading to '
         '$18.92, reducing the company’s valuation to just under $80 billion. '
         'Value investors—and Barron’s—have been optimistic about SoftBank, '
         'given that the stock trades at a huge discount to its underlying '
         'asset value. SoftBank’s single-biggest asset is its nearly 26% stake '
         'in Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), a position that continues to grow '
         'in value—Alibaba shares have appreciated 34% year to date. '
         'SoftBank’s stake in Alibaba alone is now worth just over $120 '
         'billion. It also has controlling positions in Sprint (S) and the '
         'wireless telecom company SoftBank Corp., and it owns the chip design '
         'house ARM Group, among other investments. That all makes the shares '
         'tempting to an intrepid value investor, but the company’s '
         'misjudgment on WeWork has tainted the reputation of both the firm '
         'and its founder. Until there is better news on the Vision Fund, the '
         'stock seems unlikely to make a swift recovery. Write to Eric J. '

{'body': 'The Dinos of the Dow are back in the news because Xerox is hunting '
         'big game. What’s old is new again. The Wall Street Journal says the '
         'iconic copier maker may buy HP —the famous printer maker. This, '
         'however, would be like a velociraptor taking down a T-Rex. HP '
         '(ticker: HPQ) is more than six times the size of Xerox (XRX) by '
         'sales and has more than three times the market value.The Dow Dinos '
         'are companies Barron’s identified back in February that were once '
         'components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or whose glory had '
         'faded. All seven were making comebacks.The list deserves an update, '
         'given that the report of Xerox’s interest in HP had lifted the '
         'printer company’s stock by some 10% on Wednesday morning. Think of '
         'HP—also a former Dow component—as a fossil that had languished '
         'forgotten in a museum’s warehouse.Now there are eight Dow '
         'Dinos.Dinosaurs are intrinsically interesting, but the question for '
         'investors is whether the deal will work and create a new tech '
         'hardware and services giant. It’s too early to tell. For starters, '
         'the deal can’t be done with all debt. That would be too much '
         'leverage for Xerox to handle. If an offer is forthcoming, HP '
         'investors will have to decide whether holding stock in Xerox plus HP '
         'is better than holding HP stock alone. Gordon Haskett analyst Don '
         'Bilson pointed out in a Wednesday research note that Xerox buying '
         'the larger HP qualifies as “audacious” and that activist investor '
         'Carl Icahn owns more than 10% of Xerox’s shares. Icahn might be '
         'pushing for a deal, raising the chance something concrete will '
         'develop in coming days. Xerox declined to comment.The deal report is '
         'also a reminder that investors shouldn’t forget about old '
         'businesses. They often trade at a discount to the market and can do '
         'things—like mergers or acquisitions—to generate value. HP and Xerox, '
         'for instance, trade for about 8 times estimated earnings for 2020, a '
         'big discount to stocks in the Dow. United States Steel (X) was once '
         'the largest steelmaker in the world, but now its global market share '
         'is less than 2%. General Electric (GE) was once the biggest in the '
         'world by market capitalization. Now it is not. American '
         'International Group (AIG) was decimated by the financial crisis. '
         'Alcoa (AA) has spun off assets, becoming far smaller than it once '
         'was. AT&T (T) is still gigantic, with a market value including debt '
         'of more than $460 billion, but it is no longer in the Dow. '
         'International Business Machines (IBM) and General Motors (GM) round '
         'out the seven original Dinos Barron’s identified. On average, the '
         'original seven Dinos are up about 18% year to date, closing '
         'mirroring the comparable gain of the Dow. Two laggards are weighing '
         'down the Dino Index. Alcoa and U.S. Steel—the materials '
         'companies—are doing the worst, down about 15% and 30% in 2019, '
         'respectively. It seems the age of materials is past. Innovations '
         'that Andrew Carnegie adopted leading to explosive growth in steel '
         'consumption, after all, have been around since the 19th century. As '
         'of the close of trading on Tuesday, the eight Dinos—including '
         'HP—were up about 15% year to date. HP was down about 9% before the '
         'Xerox news hit. If Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) goes private—a '
         'potential move reported Tuesday—it would open up a slot in the '
         '30-company Dow average. Perhaps the keepers of the Dow would '
         'consider taking a name off of Barron’s Dino list. Or they could stay '
         '“new” and select, say, Amazon.com (AMZN) or Salesforce.com (CRM). '

{'body': ' Uber Technologies beat Wall Street’s consensus estimates for '
         'revenue and earnings with its third-quarter results Monday night, '
         'but the stock slid on Tuesday—and again on Wednesday morning.With '
         'Tuesday’s loss, to a record closing low of $28.02, the ride-hailing '
         'stock is down 38% from its $45 initial public offering price. And '
         'that could worsen, because the IPO lockup agreement expires on '
         'Wednesday, meaning that early investors can sell their shares—which '
         'add up to about 84% of the current fully diluted share count. Here '
         'is what Wall Street is saying about the quarter and the lockup '
         'expiration. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Shyam Patil called '
         'the quarter noisy and mixed. Though revenue and earnings before '
         'interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization beat expectations, '
         'the company missed Wall Street’s mark on bookings, monthly active '
         'platform consumers, and trips. Patil said the company’s outlook for '
         'better profitability in the fourth quarter and management’s '
         'expectation it will hit positive Ebitda were both bright spots. '
         'Wedbush’s Ygal Arounian gave the quarter a B- grade, citing '
         'underlying misses that would be viewed mixed to negative. “The '
         'headline numbers were good enough and increased transparency around '
         'the business units will be a step in the right direction, however,” '
         'he noted. If the company hit break-even Ebitda in 2021, that would '
         'put the company $1.5 billion ahead of consensus estimates, he said. '
         'Guggenheim analyst Jake Fuller wrote that growth investors tend to '
         'put more weight on volume-led growth, rather than pricing-led '
         'growth. Though revenue beat expectations, he noted that was driven '
         'by revenue per trip. Still, he thinks 26% growth in monthly active '
         'platform consumers and 31% growth in rides is still solid, '
         'especially when paired with improved take rates—the percentage of '
         'each fare that the company keeps—and margins. RBC Capital Markets’ '
         'Mark S.F. Mahaney and Joseph Spak said this quarter brought bad '
         'news, good news, and great news. The bookings, users, and trips data '
         'decelerating were the bad. They cited improved take rates in both '
         'the rides business and the eats business, and the revenue beat as '
         'the good. The great was the call of positive Ebitda in 2021—a goal '
         'they feel is achievable based on the company’s recent track record. '
         'Raymond James analyst Justin Patterson said he expects the stock to '
         'come under lockup-related pressures on Wednesday. Given year-end and '
         'volatility after the IPO performance, he expects some to book the '
         'loss. “Post-lock-up, shares set up as a cleaner story for 2020.”Uber '

         'quarters.”Chief Financial Officer Chuck Boynton said in a statement '
         'that “in light of the evolving macroeconomic conditions and '
         'significant product transitions underway, we believe it is prudent '

{'body': 'Semiconductor test-equipment maker Teradyne is quietly becoming a '
         'powerhouse in discrete factory automation. That’s a fancy way to say '
         'it is getting big in robotics. The company (ticker: TER) got into '
         'the robot business through its $285 million acquisition of Universal '
         'Robots, or UR, in 2015. It was a departure for the firm, which makes '
         'equipment that tests microchips for computers and smartphones. '
         '“Semi-test equipment is a duopoly, with higher barriers to entry and '
         'good cash flow,” CEO Mark Jagiela said in an interview. “But '
         '[semi-test] secular growth is GDP plus or minus; we needed a growth '
         'platform,” he said, explaining Teradyne’s leap into industrial '
         'automation. He set out with his team to find a business that fit '
         'within the company and that had decade-plus above-average growth '
         'potential. That process culminated in the UR deal.UR robots are '
         'designed to safely work alongside humans. Larger industrial robots '
         'often require special barriers and no human interaction. What’s '
         'more, UR robots—or collaborative robots in industry parlance—don’t '
         'need sophisticated engineering support to program tasks and maintain '
         'function. They are designed for simple, monotonous tasks that '
         'factory workers might prefer not to do all day long. The Universal '
         'business is growing nicely, up 45% a year on average between 2016 '
         'and 2018. And Jagiela isn’t done. He has added other robotic '
         'technologies to Teradyne’s business portfolio. “We bought MiR in '
         '2018,” Jagiela said. MiR is short for mobile industrial robots. '
         'Teradyne purchased AutoGuide Mobile Robots in 2019. Both '
         'acquisitions move the company into AGVs, or autonomous guided '
         'vehicles, which do just what the name implies—move goods around a '
         'plant or warehouse safely and without human intervention. Amazon.com '
         '(AMZN) made an early foray into AGVs through its 2012 purchase of '
         'Kiva Systems. Now orange Kiva robots can be seen moving inventory at '
         'Amazon distribution centers, making life easier for order packers. '
         '“For MiR, think people pushing carts around a factory,” Jagiela '
         'said, explaining the MiR market niche. “We are looking for nascent '
         'markets with no incumbents.” Jagiela doesn’t intend to go up against '
         'robotics giants such as ABB (ABB) or Fanuc (6954.Japan) in their '
         'core markets. Those companies have Teradyne-like products, but the '
         'bulk of discrete-automation sales at major robot companies come from '
         'huge industrial robots used in applications such as automotive '
         'painting and welding. Jagiela explained the strategy another way. '
         '“In the case of UR, the unserved [market] was human-scale '
         'automation. Traditional automation was beyond human scale—big '
         'robots.” Are other players trying to capitalize on Teradyne’s '
         'success, producing new, smaller robots? “The [market] terrain is so '
         'vast, not a lot of knife fights,” Jagiela said. Investors are likely '
         'happy to hear about blue-sky opportunities with little competition. '
         'Investors are also likely happy with the company’s decision to '
         'invest in robotics. Since the UR acquisition, Teradyne shares have '
         'returned almost 30% a year on average, better than the 11% average '
         'annual return of the S&P 500 over the same span. Barron’s also likes '
         'the trend toward more robotic automation and wrote positively about '
         'Teradyne shares in February. Since that article appeared, Teradyne '
         'shares are up 59%, better than the comparable 7% gain of the Dow '
         'Jones Industrial Average. It doesn’t hurt that the company’s core '
         'semi-test business is doing well. “Growth in the underlying '
         'complexity of semiconductors has grown the test business faster than '
         'the overall market for handsets,” Jagiela said. “The number of '
         'cameras, processors, facial recognition all mean more transistors.” '
         'He thinks the semi-test business can increase sales at 3% to 4% a '
         'year on average for the next few years. And that cash flow from the '
         'semi-test business will continue to support Teradyne’s expansion of '
         'robotic automation. “We want to democratize automation—small shops '
         'can compete too.” Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com',

{'body': ' Symantec completed the sale of its enterprise-security software '
         'business to Broadcom for $10.7 billion on Monday. The deal allows '
         'Broadcom to keep the Symantec name, so—voilà!—the former Symantec is '
         'now NortonLifeLock, which provides cybersecurity services to '
         'consumers and small businesses. The company’s stock symbol has '
         'changed from SYMC to NLOK. It is worth taking a look. UBS analyst '
         'Fatima Boolani marked the occasion by upgrading her rating on '
         'Norton, which she thinks the market is both ignoring and mispricing. '
         'She raised her rating on the company to Buy from Neutral, increasing '
         'her target for the stock price to $27, from $23. Boolani notes that '
         'there could be confusion around the shares for a bit, while the '
         'company completes the distribution of the after-tax proceeds from '
         'the deal to shareholders. Holders will get a special dividend of '
         'about $12 a share—around half the current stock price.She said in a '
         'research note that she sees three reasons for taking a bullish '
         'stance on the revamped company. One, she has “higher conviction” in '
         'management’s ability to meet its targets of $1.50 a share or more in '
         'earnings power and $900 million or more in annualized free cash '
         'flow. Two, she noted that the stock will sport a dividend yield of '
         'about 3% postdeal. And three, she sees a compelling story in terms '
         'of earnings and free cash flow. “Amidst sweeping executive and '
         'strategic changes at Symantec, and [the] transformational sale of '
         'the Enterprise business to Broadcom, we think the market has '
         'overlooked the steadiness of the ‘RemainCo’ Consumer franchise,” she '
         'writes. “With the Enterprise divestiture now closed and upcoming '
         'earnings [on Thursday], we see catalysts for investors to revisit a '
         'cleaner, more profitable and more focused business at an attractive '
         'multiple.”She noted that the business sold to Broadcom (ticker: '
         'AVGO) accounted for 50% of the company’s revenue, but just 10% of '
         'its pretax earnings. NortonLifeLock, she says, is now being valued '
         'at 10 times forward earnings, and about 10 times enterprise value to '
         'free cash flow, for a company with low-single digit revenue growth, '
         '50% operating margins and free cash flow margins of 35% or better. '
         '“NLOK is defensive and differentiated against investor fatigue with '
         'high-beta, high multiple software stocks,” she writes. “Now '
         'unencumbered by the distracting capital intensive Enterprise '
         'business, measured reinvestments should stabilize subscriber '
         'declines.” Norton has multiple opportunities to increase average '
         'revenue per user as it “leverages its #1 market share position in '
         'consumer security with much greater focus,” Boolani said.Norton has '
         'said it would buy back $1.6 billion of stock in connection with the '
         'Broadcom deal, the analyst noted. The company also plans to boost '
         'its dividend to 50 cents a share, from 30 cents. That implies a '
         'yield of about 3%, excluding the pending distribution of the '
         'proceeds from the sale of the enterprise business to Broadcom.Norton '

         'Holdings ’ bid for the company was $22 a share, consisting of $17 a '

         'reported that Citigroup had lined up financing for the cash position '
         'of the proposal.HP (ticker: HPQ) has confirmed receiving an offer '
         'from Xerox (XRX), but neither side has commented publicly on the '
         'proposed terms, and HP hasn’t issued a public response to the '
         'proposal.In a research note yesterday, Bernstein analyst Toni '
         'Sacconaghi wrote that Xerox might simply be trying to goad HP to '
         'turn around and buy Xerox, a structure he says would make “a lot '
         'more financial sense” given that HP’s market cap is more than 3.5 '
         'times as big—$29 billion for HP, $8.4 billion for Xerox. With Xerox '
         'as the acquirer, the analyst notes, the combined company would have '
         'more than $25 billion in net debt—and he points out that Xerox '
         'doesn’t have an investment-grade debt rating as it is. The combined '
         'companies, he adds, will likely report a 4%-5% decline in printing '
         'revenue in 2019.As Sacconaghi notes, HP has struggled in recent '
         'quarters to find a way to reverse declines in its profitable printer '
         'consumables business, as more customers choose to buy third-party '
         'and remanufactured toner and ink cartridges. Sacconaghi contends the '
         'traditional printer and copier business “is slowly collapsing,” '
         'largely from a combination of increased use of digital devices, in '
         'particular larger monitors. He notes that HP’s supplies business '
         'will be down 4%-5% this year, while Xerox revenues are expected to '
         'be down 8% overall this year.The Bernstein analyst notes that press '
         'reports have suggested there could be $2 billion in synergies from '
         'combining the two companies; he thinks that’s likely a little high. '
         'He says that due to the additional debt load, early-year earnings '
         'accretion would be limited and deleveraging could take five years or '
         'more.But what if Xerox is actually trying to generate pressure on HP '
         'to turn around and bid to buy Xerox? That idea, Sacconaghi says, '
         '“feels like a crafty Icahn-esque maneuver,” a reference to investor '
         'Carl Icahn, who owns 11% of Xerox and sits on the company’s '
         'board.“After all, the highly levered combination of XRX buying HPQ '
         'would assume a lot of risk, particularly since the decay curve of '
         'print and copy volumes is highly uncertain, and arguably could '
         'negatively inflect downward, as appears to have happened with HP’s '
         'supplies business this year,” he writes. “In contrast, the economics '
         'of HPQ buying XRX would be superior, given that HPQ could do so with '
         'limited or no debt, yet synergies would be identical, likely '
         'generating immediate accretion and with limited enterprise risk.”HP '
         'is up 0.6%, at $19.69, in recent trading. Xerox is down a fraction '

{'body': 'Will someone make a bid for Sonos ? D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte '
         'raised that question in a research note Wednesday on the '
         'audio-products company (ticker: SONO)—and the notion of a potential '
         'bidder emerging gave the stock a strong lift. Forte wrote that, '
         'following the recent bid by Alphabet’s Google unit (GOOGL) for '
         'Fitbit (FIT), Sonos is the company he covers that is most likely to '
         'get a boost from either “an improvement in investors’ perception” or '
         'an acquisition.Forte, who has a Buy rating and $20 target on the '
         'stock, notes that consumer hardware hasn’t been a fruitful place to '
         'invest in recent years, and Sonos is no exception. The company went '
         'public in August 2018 at $15 a share, and trades a little below that '
         'level. Fitbit, which went public in 2015 at $20 a share, is selling '
         'to Google for $7.35 a share.“On the bad block of hardware companies, '
         'we consider Sonos to be the best house on the block and the one '
         'adjacent to the mansion on the neighboring block, Apple (AAPL),” he '
         'wrote. Forte said that, like Apple, Sonos makes products that are '
         'generally “superior to the competition,” demonstrate an “eye for '
         'design,” and sport “a premium brand,” allowing Sonos to charge '
         'premium prices. Ergo, Forte thinks Sonos would be “natural '
         'acquisition target for Apple,” strengthening the company’s offering '
         'in the connected home, “an area we believe it needs improvement and '
         'where its own product, the HomePod, was a disappointment.” One note '
         'of caution: Forte said Apple might have trouble winning regulatory '
         'approval for a Sonos deal, given recent government scrutiny of '
         'large-cap tech.A spokesperson for Sonos says the company does not '
         'comment on acquisition speculation.The Davidson analyst also sees a '
         'couple of other options for Sonos. One, it could go private—he noted '
         'that KKR (KKR) holds more than 20% of the company’s stock, and that '
         'Sonos CFO Brittany Bagley used to work at KKR. Two, Amazon.com '
         '(AMZN) could make a bid to improve its connected-home offerings, '
         'similar to its acquisitions of Blink, eero and Ring.Sonos shares '
         'rose 6.5%, to $14.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.3%. Write to '

{'body': 'Chinese search-giant Baidu (ticker: BIDU) posted '
         'better-than-expected results for the third quarter on Wednesday, '
         'driving shares up 5% in after-hours trading. Although results were '
         'still weaker compared with the year-ago period, both earnings and '
         'revenue bounced back from the historically low levels seen earlier '
         'this year. The back story. Baidu stock fell sharply earlier this '
         'year as the company suffered from soft demand and fierce competition '
         'in China’s online advertising industry. The first and second '
         'quarters saw some of the weakest total revenue growth in years. The '
         'company posted its first net loss since going public in 2005 during '
         'the first three months of 2019, although earnings later bounced back '
         'to the positive territory in the June quarter. Shares have remained '
         'under pressure, falling 32% year to date. What’s new. Baidu '
         'investors finally got some good news on Wednesday as the company '
         'reported its latest earnings.For the three months ended in '
         'September, Baidu saw its quarterly revenue grow by 3% from the '
         'year-ago period to 28.1 billion Chinese yuan ($3.93 billion), '
         'excluding the impact of divested businesses last year. The number '
         'was above Wall Street’s previous expectations for 27.6 billion yuan, '
         'which would have been a year-over-year drop for the first time in '
         'nearly three years.CFO Herman Yu noted that third-quarter revenue '
         'was up 7% from the previous three months ended in June, which had '
         'grown 9% sequentially from the prior quarter. The '
         'quarter-over-quarter growth came “in spite of the softening macro '
         'environment, industry-specific policy changes and self-directed '
         'healthcare initiative,” said Yu in a statement.Online marketing '
         'revenues, which accounted for more than 70% of Baidu’s total sales, '
         'decreased 9% from the year-ago period as China continued to face a '
         'soft economy and scaled-back business spending. On the other hand, '
         'the company’s other business areas—including video-streaming '
         'platform iQIYI, cloud services, and smart devices—kept growing at a '
         'strong pace, expanding revenue by 34% in the third quarter. Still, '
         'none of the other segments are making money yet.That’s why earnings '
         'were still under pressure, coming at 13 yuan ($1.76) per American '
         'depositary share for the third quarter. Although that beats the 8.11 '
         'yuan expected by analysts and last quarter’s 10.11 yuan, the number '
         'is still well below last year’s 19 yuan.To boost traffic growth and '
         'improve conversion rates amid China’s increasingly competitive '
         'online marketing business, Baidu has transformed its business to be '
         'more content-centric in recent years, offering news feeds and short '
         'videos on its website and mobile apps. It seems to be working in '
         'terms of user growth, at least. The Baidu mobile app saw daily '
         'active users grow by 25% year over year in the third quarter to '
         'reach 189 million, and in-app search continues to gain market share '
         'as well. “Our focus to combine search and feed and expand Baidu '
         'App’s content and services offerings is improving user experience '
         'and drawing publishers and service providers to place more content '
         'and services on Baidu’s hosted platform, which in turn draws more '
         'users,” said CEO Robin Li in the earnings statement.Li also '
         'highlighted the company’s strong momentum in the artificial '
         'intelligence businesses. Xiaodu, smart speakers powered by Baidu’s '
         'DuerOS voice assistant, ranked first in China’s smart speaker '
         'shipments in the second quarter of 2019, according to technology '
         'market analytics firm Canalys. Xiaodu’s global shipments also '
         'surpassed Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Assistant to land the second '
         'place world-wide, only behind Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Alexa. Moving '
         'forward. For the fourth quarter, Baidu expects revenues to come in '
         'between 27.1 billion and 28.7 billion yuan, representing a range '
         'between a decline of 1% to an increase of 6% compared with the '
         'year-ago period.Wall Street is divided about the stock’s near-term '
         'future, with about half analysts rating the stock as a Buy or '
         'equivalent, and the other half with a Hold. Although most analysts’ '
         '12-month target prices are higher than the stock’s level today, the '
         'upside has been narrowing. At the beginning of 2019, analysts, on '
         'average, were expecting the stock to rise by 53% in the following 12 '
         'months. As of Wednesday’s close, the average target price is at '
         '$136.10 per share, only 27% up from the current level of $107.36 '

         'revenue was $1.25 billion, up 13% from a year earlier, and just '
         'ahead of the Street’s expectations, at $1.24 billion. Earnings were '

         'consensus at $1.07. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, '
         'depreciation, and amortization came in at $266 million, down '
         'fractionally from the year-earlier quarter.In a letter to '
         'shareholders, the company disclosed that it sold 4.6 million shares '
         'of Pinterest (ticker: PINS) in the quarter, generating a return to '
         'the company of almost $160 million on a $3 million investment. IAC '

         'Match provides IAC with most of its cash flow. Match could issue a '

         'Homeservices (ANGI), but has said it doesn’t expect to address that '
         'situation until it completes the planned Match distribution. '
         'Together, those holdings account for more than 100% of the current '
         'IAC market valuation. Late Tuesday, Match posted revenue of $541 '
         'million, up 22% from a year earlier, and ahead of the Street '
         'consensus forecast at $540.6 million. Profits were 51 cents a share, '
         'up from 44 cents a year ago, and ahead of the Street at 42 cents. '
         'Guidance was lower than expected: Match expects fourth-quarter '
